for most business owners the frustrating part of using Google to grow their business is this SEO is an industry overrun with overpriced experts clueless beginners and flatout charlatan So if you only watch a few minutes of this video make it this part because this is how you know your SEO company is doing a good job If you're a business owner trying to rank number one on Google to bring in leads this is exactly what you want to see when you search for your own business And despite what most SEO companies will tell you there's no reason this should take more than a month Ranking number one on Google isn't about developing some revolutionary cheat code that hacks the algorithm It's about doing a better job than 99% of your competitors at giving Google what it actually wants and none of what it doesn't want Now if that sounds familiar and you've heard it all before the example I'm about to show you will make it crystal clear I'm Caleb and honestly I'm not part of the SEO hype crowd I'm selftaught battle tested and results obsessed And I help local businesses generate a steady stream of customers without guesswork Now take this company an HVAC contractor in Washington DC They came to me after months of frustration because in the map listings they were stuck below position 3 Barely any green coverage beyond their immediate area especially as we get farther from their GBP address They had a decent website They had decent content and they had decent links But unless someone was searching right around their office they just didn't show up Not in the three-pack or in Google Maps Not in the organic results below Meanwhile the SEO company just kept telling them it takes time Now I didn't do anything fancy I didn't build a 100 backlinks or write 50 blog posts I just changed the approach from doing traditional SEO to a local focus and started giving Google exactly what the algorithm is built to reward In less than a month the HVAC contractor wasn't just ranking they owned DC And in this video I'm going to break down how to do the same thing for your local area in five simple moves Whether you're a business owner or managing clients this will work So what does Google's local algorithm actually want there are three specific things And if you miss any of them you'll be stuck in local SEO purgatory no matter how good your traditional SEO is Google wants proof you're a real business Proof that you serve the area and proof that other local entities recognize you If you miss any of these you're invisible When someone searches HVAC near me Google needs to show businesses that can actually drive up and fix the broken air conditioner They don't want to show some national company writing blog posts about maintenance tip Google has spent 25 years trying to figure out if a business is worth recommending based on nothing except what Google can see about that business online So once I understood this everything clicked I developed this five-step system that gives Google exactly what they're looking for So let's break it down Step one align your website with Google's expectation Now most businesses have a website that's technically fine but it doesn't match what's on their Google business profile And that mismatch it tells Google this site might not be real it might not serve this area It might not be trustworthy There are two mistakes most people fall into Either they've got just five basic pages home about contact maybe a service or two or they have 300 pages but they're mostly pointless blog posts that nobody's reading and Google doesn't care about Neither one of these will help you rank It's not about having more pages but it's about having the right pages Pages that match your Google business profile pages that prove to Google we serve this area we offer this service and we're legit Please stop writing blogs that no one reads and Google doesn't care about Instead build what I call the core 30 One dedicated well ststructured page for every single category and service in your Google business profile And when I say well ststructured I mean the title tag must match your GBP primary category and include the city name It must look and feel local That way Google sees your website and your profile are talking about the same business That's how you build confidence in Google's eyes And if that sounds like a lot of work honestly it doesn't have to be Let me show you how we shortcut this using AI the right way So our step two we're going to use AI to write locally relevant content Google doesn't care who or what writes your content but it cares a lot about whether that content is actually useful Right now the common misconception seems to be type a prompt hit generate skim the output and publish it But honestly that's not enough To convince Google to promote your business your pages need to prove that you are a real business in a real city serving real people So instead of pumping out generic HVAC advice you want to use AI to write content that sounds like it came straight out of DC Talk about the neighborhoods you serve the weather your clients deal with the building codes your techs actually work under That's what separates content from local authority We've repaired air conditioning units in the Capitol Hill neighborhood for over 10 years We know how DC's human summers affect your AC system We're familiar with DC's historic district permit requirements That's the kind of content that makes Google go "Yep local real trustworthy." So without AI building 30 pages like this would be a grind But you can still use AI to do the heavy lifting as long as you feed it the right inputs And that all comes down to having the right prompt So instead when we have AI write content we're going to make sure that it knows what exactly we're writing So we're going to feed it the primary category the city the target keyword the target category we're writing for Often it's going to be the same as the primary category especially if this is your homepage We're going to give it a target length We're going to give it all the secondary categories from the GVP We're going to give it all the services from the GVP And then we have a long prompt that gives very specific writing instructions for the AI to write including a list of words to avoid If you want this prompt you can grab it in my school community in the prompt catalog There's a link in the description or pause the video and write it down If you missed this next step those first two steps really don't matter So our third step is to expose the invisible SEO gaps So let me walk you through exactly how we use AI to diagnose and fix a local SEO problem Okay first I'm going to have to use an example I'm not going to use my actual client because well we're on YouTube So I'm going to find some random business in Fort Wayne Indiana So what we're going to do is find an example in Fort Wayne Indiana I like Fort Wayne because it's a large enough city to be competitive but it's not looking at like Houston or Chicago or anything like that So I'm going to search for air conditioning repair in Fort Wayne and I'm going to skip over the top three results and just hit more businesses This is how you see results that are number four and lower No one clicks on this so basically they're invisible But this is what we want to start with Uh so I'm going to scroll down And what I'm looking for is someone who's not in the top three but they have a lot of reviews And Ralph Griffin looks pretty good here So they're well out of the top three right 1 2 3 4 five six So they're ranked sixth but they have 3,400 reviews So uh that's more than two of the players in the top three Home Comfort has 8,000 but Ralph definitely has reviews to play They're just not in the top three yet So I'd already looked at this chosen Ralph for those reasons The first thing we're going to do is run a uh local rank map for them So this is the tool we use for it is called Lead Snap and it's going to basically uh run this local rank map Now what these dots mean is every single dot is the position that your business shows up when you type in air conditioning repair near me in this location So here you'd be third Here you'd be fourth Here you'd be number one And up here you're 20th essentially invisible Now Ralph here what I care about is top three That's basically uh how visible they are So they are visible across 14% of Fort Wayne Indiana versus Co-heating and Air is visible across 26% of Fort Wayne Indiana That's twice the visibility that Ralph Griffin has So now we're going to do a very quick site audit So let's take a look at Ralph's site This is their website and we can see their title tag Let me pull this down so you can see Their title tag is HVAC service and seasonal AC furnace So HVAC service not air conditioning repair This is a common mistake A lot of HVAC professionals put HVAC professional in their title tag They should be putting air conditioning repair Much more common that people search that Okay Beyond that one of the first things I want to do is see how big the site is To do that we do this site search So site and then the domain I can hit tools and I see 352 results Uh that sounds like a lot but uh considering how poorly the site is ranking for this size they've probably been putting out a lot of blog posts And you can see even here we have Ralph Griffin Service Experts blog Blog posts just don't target the right keywords the right phrases that Google wants to see So let's take a look at what they should be writing about And for this we need to grab some data from their Google business profile So for that I'm going to use a plugin It's called GMBB Everywhere So to do that I'm going to go to Google Maps I'll search for Wal Griffin Service Experts And then I can just hit basic audit here When I do that I get shown this page here Basic audit This is from GMBB Everywhere And here I can see their full list of services and categories I can hit copy and basically export the full list This tells us what Google thinks this business actually does and your website will need to reflect that So I'm back over my school community This is another prompt we're going to use Foresight competitor analysis tool and we're just going to grab this prompt and I'm going to head on over to Claude and run it Okay So I'm going to select Opus 4 and a half I'll paste in the prompt And now we need to give it the right information uh in this prompt So here we're going to say Ralph Griffin and then the top three ranks We're going to grab Brockman Heating and Air Conditioning Mast's Heating and Cooling and Home Comfort Experts Okay And now we're going to grab the homepage content I just hit control arr C Come back over to here And now we need to run Screaming Frog So this is the tool Screaming Frog Uh it's free for up to 500 URLs so you should be able to use it and run it Um this particular website Ralph Griffin they actually had Screaming Frog blocked so I had to do a couple of things in order to get this to work The big one normally you're going to use mode in spider I set it to mode list Uh that means we basically gave it a list of URLs and I got that list of URLs from their own sitemap So for most websites you can pull up the sitemap by typing the domain and then just doing a slash sitemap.xml and that pulls all of the sites on the domain Then we can plug that into Screaming Frog and and run it Most sites you don't need to worry about that You'll just put the domain in and hit crawl But we have this crawled So I'm going to export the internal all And then I'm going to come over to links Here's links And then I will export all again and back over to Claude and we'll give it those two files I'm also going to run back over to here and I will grab the Brockman Masters and Home Comfort websites Paste those in masters and comfort experts And you can see we're asking for some very specific information for the AI to analyze and output So we'll go ahead and run that All right So the output is finished and we can see uh what it's giving us here Some technical SEO onpage content analysis Excellent So what I'm going to do is go ahead and start a new chat We'll start by uploading the same internal all and links all files Then I'm going to come in here and copy all the services Paste that to cloud also And I'll come back to my school community and grab our next prompt which is the core30 structure checker So here we're going to ask the AI to double check to make sure that the website has the full core 30 structure which means one page for every category and every service Excellent Okay And then we'll run that analysis All right So this has finished running and it's giving me the category page gaps uh homepage gaps service page gaps And with this information we now have a solid path forward for what content we need to write for this client Ralph Griffin to rank better in Fort Wayne Indiana And to write this content uh we are going to use this local SEO content writer So we'll adjust it whether we're doing the homepage or the secondary category page We'll grab this prompt that I already talked about We'll put all of the necessary information in here and have Claude write this content for us And that makes sure that this content is going to be human readable is going to be locally relevant and is going to be perfectly aligned with the Google business profile But this is where most people stop and where it all can fall apart They'll post the AI content check it with the detection tool like zero GPT and call it good But Google doesn't care if your content sounds human Again it cares whether your content is valuable So we're going to take one more step that most SEO companies skip We're going to source one solid backlink for each page Nothing expensive nothing spammy just enough external validation to show Google that this content has value Now for this I use my own private network And if you want access to the exact same inventory I use I open it up here at ice cream truck.shop But feel free to use any links that you want to But this one step getting links is what turns AI content from slop to ranking locally in just a few weeks So to recap find yourself a business to analyze Skip the top three Use Lead Snap to run a local rank map and expose ranking gaps Crawl their site with Screaming Frog and use AI with the right prompt and feed it that data Then create missing pages that align with the Google business profile Back every page with a solid backlink That's how we turn a stuck business into a local leader in a matter of weeks Now this is where a lot of SEO companies think they're done They have the content they have some links maybe even a few basic citations Let's look at the next step Step four is the citation strategy that's even more powerful than a lot of these links There's a specific kind of citation that is 10 times more powerful than the regular citations At my agency we actually call them super citations Now these are listings on 50 or so sites that most businesses never touch because they require real verification Now this is platforms like Bing for Business Apple Maps BMW's built-in navigation system and yes even voice AI systems like ChatGpt and Alexa These listings tell Google and other AI systems this business is real It's verified and it has a strong local presence These super citations also influence whether Chat GPT or voice assistants recommend your business when someone says "Find me a roofing company nearby," or "Who's the best HVAC tech in my area?" So this is the future of search and these citations power it Let me show you how to actually get these I'm going to use Lead Snap It's the same tool that I used earlier for the local rank maps and it's the tool that I use at my agency These are the citations that Lead Snap is going to get for us You can see we have the client location over here and then all of the listings along with how many of them are live submitted updated and action required that we need to be able to take If you want to try Lead Snap for yourself there's a link in the description It is an affiliate link but it will extend a free trial and give you half off your first three months if you stick with it So the bottom line here super citations aren't just another checkbox They're a trust signal for Google a data source for AI and a competitive edge most local businesses will never even hear about So now we're about to deploy the final move And as I promised at the beginning of this video this last step is the difference between clients seeing results in 6 months and seeing results in 2 weeks And it's also the one most SEO agencies either overlook or avoid because like the pursuit of excellence of most things in life it requires going the extra mile literally So step five the fastest way to go from ranking okay to ranking everywhere This is what we did that took our HVAC contractor in DC from decent rankings to owning the map pack You need to build real local trust Not just in Google's eyes but in the eyes of real people and local organizations So here's what that actually looks like Join the local chamber of commerce Sponsor a youth baseball team Get listed in your city's preferred contractor directory These aren't just links These are massive signals of trust And Google knows exactly how to read them So does ChatGpt So does Gemini So does Google's own AI overview and every other AI that pulls verified local data Another one of my clients a personal injury attorney in New Orleans they were stuck at position 8 for months Great site good content still invisible So then we joined the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce We joined 10 other nearby chambers of commerce We sponsored a local event the Bayou Bash or something and overnight they jumped to position three The next morning their first lead was a $14,000 case That's not SEO It's trust proximity and authority in action and it works fast So let me show you how we scale this using AI for that Fort Wayne Indiana example Back in the school community we have another prompt here the local link builder Uh basically you're going to put in the city name and the type of business and then you're going to run this prompt The AI is going to find and sort by order of importance all of the different uh types of local organizations that you can join and will give you high-powered locally relevant links back to your business or your client's business website These are powerful locally relevant links that prove you're embedded in your community You're not just trying to gain the algorithm And when you stack these on top of the right content and those citations that's when you stop ranking in one zip code and start owning the entire city Now look I just gave you the exact system that took this business from invisible to fully booked But if you're being honest with yourself ranking might not be your biggest challenge None of this matters if you can't grow your agency and land clients I see SEO agencies all the time super talented amazing case studies but they're still stuck trying to hit 10K a month because they've never figured out how to sell their services to local business owners Maybe they could rank a business in 2 weeks but they can't get a business owner to pay them $2,000 a month Why because the ranking game is completely different from the client acquisition game Different psychology different objections different process So if you want to see the exact system that got me 97 clients in 6 months click the video right here before you waste another month with amazing skills but an empty bank account Siru you're one shift away from turning all of this ranking power into real revenue
