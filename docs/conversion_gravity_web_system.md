## 2. Core Pillars of the Build

1. **Gorgeous Aesthetics**: Use glassmorphism, smooth gradients, and premium typography. No generic defaults.
2. **AI Lead Capture**: Every site must have an embedded AI chatbot to capture leads and book calls 24/7.
3. **Automated Nurture**: Immediate handoff to automated email/SMS sequences after lead capture.
4. **Fast Deployment**: Target "Live & Deployed" within 60 minutes for core structure.
5. **High-Value Packaging**: This system creates assets worth $2k–$10k in the open market.

## 3. Workflow for Haul Command Assets

*   **Step 1: Benchmark**: Find 3 premium inspirations on Dribbble/Mobbin.
*   **Step 2: Copy**: Generate high-intent copy using Google AI Studio (Gemini 1.5 Pro).
*   **Step 3: Build**: Use Cursor to build the front-end (Vite/Next.js) or GHL Page Builder for standard funnels.
*   **Step 4: Automate**: Link all forms to the **Shared Spine** (Supabase) + GHL workflows.
*   **Step 5: Voice**: Generate any required onboarding/explainer audio via ElevenLabs.
