TITLE: DON'T Build workflows, Build AI Systems (AntiGravity)
ID: f2b9da89-83c9-41f5-81a2-0f064fe48374

or any10g.com dead because something just fundamentally changed google just released anti-gravity and it lets you build full AI systems in minutes instead of hours without the need to build very complicated workflows i built and sold my last tech startup over 60,000 customers and I run a 7 figureure AI automation business and the way that I operate my business has completely changed now and in this video I'm going to show you the new way to build AI systems quickly so that you can build anything you want to and make more money without wasting your time so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in and I'll also include all the system prompts down below in description including this master prompt that makes building an anti-gravity on easy mode so Google's anti-gravity you can build anything build apps websites it can be your personal Javas you can build AI systems for anything it is as they say very cool but if you go back in time only six months ago workflow builders were everywhere meg.com NA10 it really dominated the kind of attention sphere and then we had the rise of vibe coders this is stuff like bolt and lovable and various other platforms and now we have anti-gravity it can basically do all of it it can do everything so the idea is instead of building a scenario node by node like we used to in workflow builders what we can now is basically say hey build this thing for me and anti-gravity will actually go ahead and do that for us so because anti-gravity and this is one of the key geniuses of it connects to all of our apps there's something called MCP which stands for model context protocol think of it kind of like your universal remote control where it just connects to an app and it can do anything within that app it can connect to your Google calendar it can tell you everything that's going on and it can also run which makes it very unique and 10 times more powerful parallel agents meaning you can have five six seven eight agents all working on independent things for you at the exact same time you no longer have a one agent bottleneck in that sense so the use cases now for n10.com were typically a way to talk to lots of services a place to run things on a schedule and a way to glue steps together for example you would get something in your CRM and now I want to go ahead and update that right send them an email or something and it was also really good and is really good for error handling but anti-gravity actually does all of that plus it thinks and you can also chat with it which basically means you now have this 500 IQ co-pilot that knows everything about your business and your productivity and on top of that you can build out these full AI systems and so I've always found the best way to learn an anti-gravity is by actually doing it so in this video I'm going to show you my five-step system the blast framework to build literally anything within anti-gravity and what we're going to build today is an app that I actually sold for about $9 or $10,000 and so essentially what it's going to be is we're going to have our AI notetaker in all of our meetings and we're going to have a system that automatically grabs that entire transcript turns it into actions and puts it in our notion database and if we want to we can also have the AI go ahead and action that for us and at the end of the video I'm also going to cover the exact use cases I'm using now for NA10 and make so you don't throw the baby out the bath water you know exactly what's working today in 2026 so let's go ahead and grab the prompt i'm going to put this down below for you in the description so you can use this this is honestly crazy and it works so so effectively as you'll see so in the ant gravity let me come grab our anti-gravity master prompt and explain what it is so you get a really good idea of the context of what we're going to do so the idea is anytime we're building an anti-gravity what we're going to do is give it this system prompt okay so it's basically a system pilot where we have a very set and structured way of working because anything you build in anti-gravity will touch on these five steps whether it's a dashboard or a system an onboarding system or whatever the thing is or a website okay so we basically tell it a protocol zero to create for us a Gemini MD file i'm going to go through these step by step to understand what the protocols are we've got the blueprint the discovery section where we tell it things like northstar integration source of truth we go through the links and connections we're going to architect it stylize it trigger it and then we've got key operating principles and the file reference structure so all you do is you're going to come down and you're going to copy all of this stuff here for the blast system prompt and then we're going to head over to anti-gravity and now within anti-gravity let's create a brand new folder together come down and let's call this one something like intelligence system cool because it's a very cool intelligent system sweet and then click on open so within the project and the reason why we want to give it this file every single time is simply because anti-gravity is this insane 500 IQ AI but it's only as good as the prompts that you give it so we want to steer it so check this out we want to make sure that we're in planning mode for this and all you're going to do is enter in that and that is the entire system protocol and anti-gravity now will initialize with this and so imagine you and I running a business together and we hire somebody and let's just imagine they are the smartest person on the planet but the problem is they're in a room got all the tools that they need but they have no idea what they're doing or what the objective is or what they're even hired to do because we never communicated that an idea is you give it bad instructions you get bad outputs gemini is exactly the same way which is why the first B in our five-step framework stands for blueprint the vision and logic and so within the step here as you can see we're going to ask a couple of questions one is the north star so this is basically explaining in language what is the thing that we want and the cool thing about anti-gravity is that we can just yap we have integrations so what is it going to connect with is it connecting with fireflies and notion we've got the source of truth which is where the data is going to live the delivery payload which is where do you want it to go and then we've got the rules of how the system should act so now we know that let's head over to anti-gravity and as you can see look at this guys i've initially initialized the anti-gravity project structure within Gemini MD and required directory so every project you spin up now anti-gravity is going to pull all this stuff on the left hand side you don't have to worry about it think about it i have spent days and weeks in this going very deep so you don't actually have to think about it so we've got all this stuff now it's asking us for the north star and we do all this conversationally and as you can see what it's done really crucially here is it's pulled together this anti-gravity initialization tasks with protocols and all the different things so we are in protocol zebra so let's give it the in natural language what we're talking about and of course we're using glider for speech to text which we just released in beta so let's go ahead and talk about it cool the desired outcome I want is essentially I am going to have meetings i have my AI notetaker join those meetings which is fireflies what I would like to happen is a script that runs that effectively goes to my latest meeting and then basically understands the transcript and creates any actions that I have from the meeting and I want to put that into one page in notion called Jack's actions so any meeting I have gets added to this one page in notion awesome then let's talk about integrations the integrations are going to be with notion we're going to use an MCP for that we're also going to use Fireflyy's MCP as well as that cool and then we've got the source of truth where does the primary data live cool so in terms of the source of truth the data is going to be extracted from Fireflies and it's going to be inputed within notion how and where should it be delivered well again I want you to put that within notion please and the behavioral rules how do I want the system to act well first of all I want to validate that it works and then once it's done that and I'm happy with the system I then want you to run automatically in the background every three hours checking for meetings for me once we've established that this works and of course when you check for meetings I only want you to add it if it's new awesome so we're going to send it off and that essentially is for phase one now we've described the process and exactly what that looks like now our 500 IQ intern that now knows everything that we're doing in our business wouldn't really be that great if they didn't have a laptop they didn't have connection to the internet which is why the second step of our BLAST framework actually stands for links in other words we've now got to give anti-gravity the ability to connect to all the things that we need because if it can't connect to notion if it can't connect to our AI meetings notetaker it's not going to be able to do anything we need to which is why we need to now give anti-gravity all of the connections and if you're not familiar with Fireflies.AI it basically is just one example of many AI meeting notetakers actually Notion has one as well I believe but the idea is it will join your call it will transcribe everything and take a full transcript of it so we're going to be using Fireflies but there's loads of different alternatives now let's come back over here and what we need to do now basically is make sure that we are connected to Fireflies and notion which is really cool so how do we do that well one of the and look at this guys can I just point this out look it's already ticked off blueprint we've given it the structure and whatever structure you're going through you do need to think about the blueprint you need to think about the link i can go through the sections in a second so what we're going to be using is MCP mcp servers is what takes off 500 IQ AI and connects it to the world and remember when you connect anti-gravity to these systems they can effectively do anything so look you click on MCP servers now anti-gravity has an inbuilt store of things and within that inbuilt store are a couple of things we can use one of them is notion like so so let's click on notion now I've installed mine you may not have installed yours yet if you want to install it you click on configure and you click on this link and what this does is open up notion profile integrations and all you're going to do is click on new integration i'm going to call this one something like let's call this one brain for example associate workspace will be the one that you create and then you can even give it a Lego if you like i've given it a coffee logo because as you know I'm a Jack Roberts YouTube channel we like our coffee so we come down and we click on save which is great and integration has been successfully created now it's been created guys all you're going to do is click on show and you're going to copy this code which for argument sake let's just say it was this but you're going to show this and copy it you come back over to anti-gravity and your notion API token you enter it in there click save and then what happens is when you come to manage MCP servers and you'll see here on the left hand side you're going to have notion and notion is now fully enabled and you have all of this beautiful access there little side tip for you by the way is if you there's a thing called the MCP marketplace so if you're thinking Jack what could I connect to check this website out it has everything in that you can literally connect to people joining the community to join the beautiful wonderful vibe and success we have over there so you got all this sort of stuff you can literally find everything you want to connect to to give your ideas and connect those servers so that now means that notion is connected let me show you what it means so if you load up notion for example let's say that I've got this page here actually within notion the way that notion works is you give each page a unique access so you just click on these links here i'm going to come down to connections this is currently connected to anything and what you'll see is if I come down and show you this what did we call it i think we called it brain look at this brain created by Jack and this now means that has access to this page but I'm going to connect it to my actual one as well which is add connection and I think the one that I've got into gravity is this one here we confirm and now anti-gravity can come and amend this master prompt if it wanted to now the next thing we need to do is add in Fireflies MCP so what is the Fireflies MCP well I keep a list of it here but let me just show you how you would get this so and this is a really important thing to understand now you'll notice it's not in the store so well what do we do then well one of the things that we can do and in fact why don't we even open up a random chat with Gemini and chat about this so what you can do is you head over to something like any model you want to in the world which is really really cool and you can have a conversation with it so for example let's say that I say "Hey there dude i want to connect to the Fireflies MCP can you give me the MCP config for that thing?" Awesome and we hit off and we send it enter and just like that we get the JSON i will put this down below for you as well just so you can copy and paste it and follow along and what you're going to do is copy the JSON right then when you come back to anti-gravity one of the things you'll notice you I've actually already got mine connected here but the way that you do that is you click on view raw config and you'll see this big beautiful line of code what I want you to do is come back to the agent and again you can do this in many different windows and you're going to say give the following prompt which is hey I want you to add the below MCP config to this entire list okay the first thing you're going to do is going to say my MCP config okay and then you're going to copy all of this like so crl and C come down and then you're going to hit paste and then you're going to say mcp config to add right and then come back over and grab your fireflies which is this one right here we're going to come back we're going to paste this one in like this and then we need to get our fireflies API key so let's go ahead and grab that and you can grab that by going on settings coming down to I believe it's developer settings awesome and then you'll see the AI key so literally just copy that API key right there you're going to come back over and where it says your Firefly's API key here just delete that and type in whatever the thing was then when you hit enter what this will do is give you a full piece of text and all you're going to do is copy it you're going to do Ctrl A delete all of it and then Ctrl +V all the things it gives you click on file click on save and then the whole thing will be done for you instantaneously and then when you come back to manage MCP servers and you hit refresh you'll actually see Fireflies and then you'll also see notion which now means that anti-gravity has the ability to access anything little tip by the way you want to try and keep your tool usage no more than 50 just so it doesn't really affect its memory its context that kind of thing so you can activate and deactivate things as you go along now we've added all of the connections let's go back to the agent and have a conversation about what it needs so let's look at the link status so Fireflies is connected and it's found it awesome notion I searched for Jack's items so it hasn't found notion let's have a look then so notion page decision use page create new and it's looking for the different tokens so now let's just explain to it the following which is hey there dude we have a fireflies and a notion MCP i would like to use both of those things to basically execute the entire workflow if this is confirmed and you have access to that let's then proceed to the next step in our process awesome so again now we've got a very very clear task list that we're working through as you can see which is link it together and it's creating a basically what I've asked it to do is create a virtual handshake between the scripts which essentially means that it's reaching over touching and feeling Fireflies i can got that i can get all the data i'm reaching over i can touch and feel notion and now we know that it's connected we can move on to the next step and just like that guys it's now done it so it's done two things it's created an action page for me in notion so let's come and check this one out real quick and we're going to click on open so we can see the beauty here no notion we don't want to open on the desktop browser is fine for us we got Jack's action page we don't like the design but I'm going to come back to that in a second and I'm going to come back over and it's also done one other thing which is basically valid Fireflies MCP and it's covered our glider weekly and it's found five actions for me oh my goodness guys i need to put the coffee down and start cracking on and things so this is very cool little tip for you as well by the way remember at any point you can change the model down here and if you ever find that Gemini 3 Pro gets stuck in a thinking loop just switch it over to Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Claude Sonnet 4.5 thinking remember anti-gravity is our jet our kind of superpowered super jet from the future and the pilot is who we can change based on what we want to do sometimes it's Gemini who's an amazing designer sometimes it's Claude who's incredible and Claude can still access the MCPS in just the same way so if you ever find yourself stuck in a loop you can always switch to models to move along and so now we've set up the plan and we've given all the connections the next thing that we need to do then is basically create the SOPs which is exactly how it's going to go ahead and do its job think of this as the actual wiring and the plumbing and in our analogy with our 500 IQ interim she knows where she's working she now has access to everything she's got her beautiful coffee cuz you know JR HQ everyone's caffeinated as much as they want and they've got their laptop what we now need to do is explain exactly what we need them to do and specifically how it works which is why the third step of our five-step framework stands for architect and there are actually only three layers to the architecture so look what we're basically saying here to anti-gravity is that you operate within a three layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability so LLMs as we know are probabilistic which basically means when you ask it the same question 100 times you will get a 100 different answers because it's a next word prediction tool but business logic needs to be deterministic needs to be reliable especially with all the clients that we work with in our agency and all the people we help with in our education business it's really important that if I run it 100 times I get the exact same thing 100 times which is the difference between probabilistic and deterministic so how do we make these workflows deterministic well this by these layers so first one is architecture the technical SOPs written in markdown we're going to define the goals the inputs the tools the logic and the edge cases and then we've got the golden rule which basically look if logic changes you update the SOP before updating the code the SOP becomes like the gold standard okay then we've got navigation which is the second layer which is the reasoning layer you root data between SOPs and tools you do not try to perform complex tasks yourself you call execution tools in the right order so we don't need you to think you're going to follow a very clear deterministic workflow and then we've got tools so deterministic Python scripts atomic and testable environment variables are stored inv best practice but always good to explain and then use tmpmp for all intermediate file options awesome so now we come back over to anti-gravity and we're going to say something lines of this sounds great let's now proceed to phase three cool cuz we've basically validated and done everything so now it's going to go through the architecture phase typically speaking this will all be kind of hands off but at this stage we're actually going to test that the architecture works perfectly for us beautiful and just like that it's worked in the background and it has completed it and has deployed the system so let's actually check that it physically works first of all i'm going to give it a prompt it's going to say "Hey dude what I'd like you to do is grab my last meeting from Glider and I want you to go ahead and add my top five actions from that meeting to the notion page and then give me a link to the notion page so that I know all this works properly." Awesome send this off and then we can validate that the entire system works for us okay beautiful so now it's done let's actually open up this notion page and see if it's got all the beautiful actions that I'm doing for Gladder let's open this one up and just like that we've now got my actions we've got the meeting we've got the date of the meeting and my actions underneath it and he did all of this just by communicating with the Fireflies MCP and the same with notion and so now we've actually validated it we've given it a mission we've given the connections and it's working properly the next thing we need to do is to do it with some grace some style and some pizzazz because doing the job is one thing but looking great while you're doing it it's something completely different and if you're building dashboards or websites or using anything we want to take one specific step to make sure that it looks amazing we don't want people to think we want to look the best in class and with the latest Gemini model we can make things look gorgeous now I've actually picked a business use case in this video which we do a lot of obviously on the Jack Robbers YouTube channel and it's because like we still want to think about design so like I like notion but I want to have various different design components so just take this as an opportunity to really go deep on the design remember functionality first then we do the design once we've locked that bit down and if we look at phase four on our master prompt we've got payload refinement which is formatting all outputs slack blocks notion layouts email HTML etc the UI and UX for the front end and then we've got feedback so let's go ahead and give it some feedback now over here cool so let's come over here i'm going to give it some cool feedback which is "Hey there dude i want the notion page you created to look better give it a header i want an emoji per action line for every single item that we get and I want you to use all of the different formatting aspects within notion maybe like a tip or insight that you could include based on the actions maybe a slight summary of the meetings just make it visually and beautifully engaging using the full suite of tools and formatting options available within notion it should be clear to understand and gorgeous to look at so do that on the Jack actions page and then I want you to update the SOP with the rules that I've just given you awesome we send that one off bam we probably saved ourselves about 3 minutes in typing as well which is awesome and then now once we've done this we can move on to step five but let's validate it looks as great as we want obviously what we can do there's so many different things with design and I'll put a link somewhat on screen so you can check out our full AI design systems which is where this really shines but even even when it's for business stuff like you're presenting this to clients it's like first impressions matter one of my favorite books actually of all time is don't make me think and it's a general idea that things should just kind of like breeze over you shouldn't have to engage your system to critical thinking it should be easy and remember there's no such thing as a confused buyer awesome so now anti-gravity has made those adjustments let's go check out the notion link and you can do this by clicking this link beautiful so now we've got this gorgeous blue summary so the team discussed me a comprehensive funnel dashboard to track acquisition and engagement talking about cohorts for better analytics how cool is that so now I literally I have my meeting i don't touch anything this gets updated i get this blue little dashboard here and I get all my action items which is so awesome and we can do so many things about this and think about anti-gravity right it can effectively do anything for us so I could then have anti-gravity start to work on my actions for me so let's say I have an action to go ahead and research the best funnel for this or the best strategy for that anti-gravity can start doing that work for me and I can even get it to hey this is your pre-prepared work and have it added underneath my notion that's where we're at now in 2026 it is literally gamechanging and now we've actually finished the UI that we're happy with obviously this looks very different for every application the next thing we need to do with our 500 IQ super agent is they've done the work they've done everything on the laptop now we just need to send it off we need to deploy it now this is the really interesting difference between anti-gravity and it make is that we can run things on our laptop right and we can say "Hey we can build anti-gravity skills." I'll put a link on screen to check that out and it can do it autonomously but what if you know I don't want to have to trigger this what if you and I are at the gym together we're drinking some beautiful water maybe we've got our coffees whatever we're doing and I want this to trigger in my sleep maybe I want to scrape a website maybe I don't need my laptop open so to do this we're going to deploy the function and set this up in such a way that whether we're touching our laptop or not this is going to run for us every hour every 3 hours without us touching a single thing which is why the fifth step in our five-step framework stands for trigger and to deploy this we're going to be using a service called modal which is really ace and what it basically will do is clone the code that we've created and fire it off at intervals and we connect anti-gravity to modal as you can see it's an infrastructure developers love also vibe code did a cool thing if you touch it the whole cube explodes into mini cubes i didn't realize that but anyway that's besides the point let's go over to the dashboard of the modal and I'm going to show you exactly how you basically get this whole thing set up so it actually already did this for me because I actually connected modal already but I'm going to show you how you do this specifically so all you do when you're logged in and by the way you can get like five bucks for free per month so if you're running something every 3 hours it's not going to cost you anything with this sort of stuff so all of your apps will be here and all you're going to do is click on quick start guide right and you see this code here i want you to copy that code and then head back over to anti-gravity and then in anti-gravity all you're going to do is come down here and you're going to paste this in here like so okay but what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask it to delete it and remove it from modal and then we're going to reset this one up together just so you see exactly how it goes so I've deleted it now which means in live apps it should not be there just so we can go through the process together cuz I I never want to do those things where they just gloss it i want to give you the specific step by step so all we ever do in Mod to connect anything so if you're thinking you want to reach over and do something so we can build these as anti-gravity skills so we could turn this into a skill which is kind of like an Iron Man analogy is like a jetpack or a plasma beam or whatever and we can activate it whenever if you want to build infrastructure that runs without you even thinking about it we deploy it to Modal and we can specify and here's a cool thing you can tell anti-gravity how often you want it to run it's so cool quick start guide copy this code and head over to anti-gravity within anti-gravity you're going to come down and just going to give it this code here what this will do is open up a brand new window and then you're going to sign in to Moto like this so it's running now and this is all done in the chat interface that's how freaking cool it is and just like that it's opened up it's asking to create a token it says I'm in Dubai which I am the beautiful wonderful sunny Dubai and all you're going to do is click on authorize like so and then when it's done it's creating an API token you hear that sound in the background let's anti-graph you're saying "Hey Jack I like the sound what you just did." When we come back over and as you can see it's now connected and the cool thing about this is that we can now publish it so let's just say want to do this okay what I want you to do is set this up to run every 3 hours and update it to that notion if there are no new updates don't add anything else okay and I want you to make sure that the latest three meetings are updated and fully live within notion so if they're not there then you're going to add them in okay beautiful and then we're going to send this one off like that and then what this will do is actually update modal for us directly and I want to just explain what's happening in Mod okay so it's going to create the app for us but let me just show you how everything works here so we've got logs which effectively is everything that is happening within modal and then you have secrets so you might be wondering Jack this is really cool right but but how does it know what my superbase credentials are how does it know what my I don't know my notion credentials are well what anti-gravity will do with that token that we just created is create a secret within modal which means that it will have access to that so if I click into superbase secrets here is if for instance which I created previously you can see we've got usage if you come to references nothing there but if you click on edit what you'll see is a superb basease key and a superbase URL which means in modal it can actually go and affect and do different things i could say for example for anti-gravity when you're done I want you to update this Google sheet i want you to update air table i want to update Superbase it'll go ahead and do that for us so you can see what that looks like you can also store stuff in modal if you want to and then which is great so you can see it's got names various different things but if I come back over to apps right now we've got no live apps but look this has now just been created for us which is awesome less than 20 seconds ago if I come back over now like this it's asking me to accept the changes let's go ahead and provide that which is awesome and let's verify our deployment it even gives us a link to click how generous is anti-gravity these days guys so we're going to come back over let's actually click on it now what's really cool is you'll see all the logs as you go down so what I'm going to do is click on run now which you can just do whenever you want to so it's scheduled an immediate run this is going to run for us instantaneously it will pan it usually takes a couple seconds if it's got nothing to add it'll be done in 3 seconds but if it like actually is bringing the stuff over it will be like 17 or so seconds what's also really cool is we have two types of automation we can run with a modal type one is what we call a dumb automation which in other words is it is grabbing one thing and grabbing something else and the second one is a smartmon that has an API now interestingly this one's failed which is awesome because I can actually show you how to troubleshoot this one so if I click on the statuses failed which is awesome going to click on logs and it'll show us exactly what went wrong so let's come down here and find this one out there we go so this is what happened so all we're going to do is literally copy this we come back over here and we just paste that one in there like so and we just say "Hey the automation failed please make sure that it has access to notion and also Fireflies and it has the appropriate secret access." Awesome and we send that one off and just like that it sees an issue there's a missing import development script let me fix that interestingly when I built this yesterday I just did it like instantaneously no errors so I'm very thankful that I can show you exactly how you troubleshoot and the cool thing is anti-gravity isn't just the builder it's the fixer itself anneals it does everything we need to do which is freaking awesome cool so the deployment is now complete which is ace so let's go ahead and check it once that's done right let's swing back over now to our dashboard click off this one come back over to the overview beautiful click on this one and then let's just run this one now and that should be a big and beautiful and wonderful success and so the second one needed one further adjustment and then it succeeded for us perfectly and by the way all I did is I switched from Claude back to Gemini 3 which for some reason just seems to really get the modal integration which is fascinating again we switch out the pilots when they need the coffee breaks take a second we can do that instantaneously but again first time I deployed this it's usually flawless but it's great to learn how to do that and actually just if you FYI if you're wondering what was um happening there you can see the issue was that it didn't add the root/tool system path so where possible it's way better to stick with Gemini that's following the initialization task on the right hand side but what's really cool here the upshot guys is it's now done and when that's done now one of the cool things is you can actually check on the house of this whenever you want to so I can click on this for example and I can see exactly what it did and everything it ran ran the automation which is awesome processed the the meetings and it was pretty much done and you can see down here no new meetings to process all latest free meetings already processed so it gives you that update and then I could say dude if I wanted to I could just have this added to a super base for now table and have a dashboard so I can check in on the health of all my automation so I get a visual dashboard of the 10 things I've got running and I know exactly what's happening for every single automation so this now means that you've got an application that works whether your laptop's closed or not i'm going to put a link down below for the full motion guide but remember that's just a fraction of all the value that we have inside the community and as an important PS we're doing a meetup in South Africa London next month and then Japan in April so it' be great to see you in person and shake your hand and have a beautiful coffee but now you've actually covered all the wonders of building in anti-gravity i want to touch on when I would actually use NA10 and make this is a really important note to understand and this is probably best explained by an example so I've got an agent here right that has access to all my emails all of my calendars and all my Google Drive and I connected this via an MCP to anti-gravity in my personal CEO assistant which means if I say "Hey dude one of my meetings today give me some research for it." It will do that for me instantaneously so the first use case is I use N8N obvious these platforms now as a connector right Zap year is a connector N10 is a connector it enables me to connect to different apps the other thing is if you're building a workflow that is very very deterministic in other words someone joins the CRM or someone completes a form and then these six things are happening then these seven things are happening when you get really complicated workflows sometimes it's easier to build it in a platform like NHM or you again you can do this in anti-gravity you don't need to to use these platforms anymore that's why they're so amazing but when it's very complicated or you're sharing it with clients and you want to be able to do things like debug N10's great for stuff like that because you can come into executions for example see where it failed where it didn't fail and actually go and say "Okay it failed there on January 16th what happened?" And you can get a bit more of a visual overview and you can construct agents to do different things remember anti-gravity we're coding with words but if you want to visual grab things you can still use these technology i would say that my usage of these no code platforms has definitely gone down like very significantly and you don't need to touch them anymore but there are some use cases it was complicated that you may prefer to build in a no code builder and now that you've learned the blast system to build anything in anti-gravity the next thing is to learn how to build incredible and gorgeous designs that will make it look like you've had like a five figure design agency to build it and you can learn that by watching this video right
