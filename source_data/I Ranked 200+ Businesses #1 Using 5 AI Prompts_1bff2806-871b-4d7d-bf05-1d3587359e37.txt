TITLE: I Ranked 200+ Businesses #1 Using 5 AI Prompts
ID: 1bff2806-871b-4d7d-bf05-1d3587359e37

i used five AI prompts to rank over 200 local businesses number one on Google Maps most agency owners waste 10 hours or more per client doing manual SEO work which means you can't scale without burning out so in this video you're going to get the exact five copy and paste prompts that built my sevenfigure agency and helped hundreds of freelancers rank clients faster while working half the hours and if you stick around I'm going to show you a bonus prompt that catches the mistakes that silently kills your rankings the quality control step 90% of agencies skip now to start I'm going to show you the first prompt that builds the foundation every local business needs to rank so the first prompt we're going to talk about is the GVP categories and service generator this is a multi-step process that sets up the foundation for everything else we're about to do so here's why this matters when I audit local businesses over 60% of them have exactly one category on their Google business profile just one and maybe they've listed three or four services if we're lucky but Google let you add up to 10 categories and you should be listing 20 or 30 services when you only have one category and a handful of services you're telling Google you do one thing your competitor who has five categories and 30 services they're telling Google they're comprehensive authority in that space let me give you a real example i had a plumber in Plano who came to me he'd been stuck at position 17 for months so the first thing I checked one category three services listed so he added three secondary categories and 32 more services within a week he jumped to position 12 this is the same business the same reviews the same website we just told Google what he actually did in this plumbing space so here's how you do this first install a Chrome extension called GMBB Everywhere pull up your top three competitors and you'll instantly see every category and every service they're using select one of the categories and GMBB Everywhere will tell you how many GVPs are currently using that category and the most common secondary categories they're also using a great way to choose the most relevant categories for your GBP is to see what other competitors are doing so now we're going to use AI to fill in these gaps and find opportunities that your competitors might have missed so once you have your categories we're going to move to step two and generate the services now here's where most people mess up they have 30 services they have 40 categories but no idea which services go under which category you need this organized correctly because Google's algorithm looks at the relationship between your categories and services to determine relevance for search queries so we're going to use another prompt to sort everything based on how Google's algorithm sees the semantic connections this prompt is a little bit longer but I'll still going to show it on screen go ahead pause it so you can grab it or join my school community there's a link in the description that'll have my prompt and the full prompt library of all the other ones featured on my YouTube channel you'll also receive access to an SEO community with 3,000 people ready to answer your questions and even a monthly Q&A with me so after you run this categorization prompt log into the Google Business profile and configure your categories and services this whole process of making sure your categories and services are correct is going to take you maybe 30 minutes but here's what you need to understand every category and service that you just added those need to become pages on your website you can't just list them on the GBP and call it done google needs to see that your website matches what your GBP says you do that's where our next prompt comes in this is the prompt that creates your foundation pages your homepage and your category pages and this is where you start building the connection between your GVP and the website that Google is looking for and here's why this matters google needs to connect your business entity with your service entity and your category entities if your GVP says you're a plumber offering drain cleaning but your website never mentions drain cleaning Google doesn't understand the connection the algorithm can't confirm that you actually provide that service but when everything on your GBP matches what's on your website the same categories the same services the same location Google sees a verified entity now that verification directly impacts your GBP ranking if your website doesn't back up what your GBP claims you're not going to be ranking in the top three and here's what most local businesses get wrong i analyzed 100 local business websites a couple months ago do you want to know the most common homepage title tag home just the word home over 60% had the word home or just their business name no category no city nothing home is the default for a lot of website builders out there and so many local businesses didn't bother to update the default now keep in mind that your homepage title tag is no exaggerating the most important words on your site to inform Google of what you want to rank for so they're all telling Google that they want to rank for the word home now when you fix this one thing you're already ahead of 60% of your competitors i had a plumber in Bosezeman Montana his title tag was the word welcome we changed it so that it included plumber Boseman and within two weeks he went from position 7 to position 30 same website same concept and yeah okay it was Boseman not Houston houston's going to need more than just the right title tag but in small markets this alone can move you into the top three so this next prompt create your whole page content optimized for your primary category plus city name you're going to run this same prompt multiple times with different inputs once for the homepage targeting your primary category and then once for each of your secondary categories so if you have five categories you're going to run this five times that will be one primary category and four secondary after you generate the content read through it please don't post AI generated content on your website without even reading it ai is going to get you 80 to 90% of the way there but you still need to add the final 10 to 20% fix any weird phrasing add actual client stories make it sound like a human wrote it this takes maybe 10 minutes per page then you can copy paste it into your website builder make sure the title tag matches the format category plus city plus additional context make sure your H1 matches your title tag doesn't have to be the same words but it needs to include category plus city and make sure you're linking from your homepage to each category page both versions of this prompt are in the school community with the exact format I use and examples of the outputs go ahead and grab them there but we're not yet done because now you have five category pages but you have 20 or 30 services each one of those services needs its own page and this is where we scale from five pages to 25 in a single afternoon you have your homepage you have your category pages now we need a dedicated page for every single service on your GBP if you listed 20 services you're going to create 20 pages this is what separates businesses that rank from businesses that don't and now here's why this works when someone searches water heater repair Kansas City Google is looking for pages that match that exact search if you have a generic plumbing services page you're competing against businesses with dedicated water heater repair pages you're going to lose that every single time that plumber in Plano I mentioned them earlier we got them from 17 to position 12 just by adding categories and services to the GBP he's getting some calls but not very many position 4 and worse is invisible so we use this prompt to create 20 more service pages in one weekend he had 33 but we created 20 each page targeted a specific service plus the city name within another week he jumped from position 12 to position 2.35 here's his rank map he made $50,000 in the first month just from the increased call volume of being ranked in the top three and here's the thing it's the same prompt structure you just used for the homepage and categories the only difference are the inputs instead of targeting plumber Plano you're now targeting water heater repair plano water heater replacement plano drain cleaning plano or whatever the specific service is here's that prompt now you're going to run this prompt at least 20 times once for every service on your GBP every prompt is going to take about 2 minutes to set up and run ai generates the content in another minute or so and you're going to spend 15 minutes editing it that's about 20 minutes per page for 20 pages you're looking at about five hours total to create a website structure that's going to put you ahead of 95% of the local businesses in your market after you generate all of these service pages make sure each page has a title tag that includes the service plus city name make sure you're linking from the relevant category page to each service page so your plumbing contractor category page should link to all the plumbing services that live underneath that category on your GVP this creates what we call a content silo google sees that your website is comprehensively covering every aspect of your business it sees the topical relevance it sees the geographical relevance that's what moves you up the map pack as with the other ones you can find that prompt in my school community link in the description now here's the catch you have 25 pages of shiny new content all optimized all structured correctly all with the correct internal linking but Google doesn't trust it yet google needs to see that other websites especially other local websites are vouching for your business and if you don't get this next step right everything you just built is going to cap out around position 7 so let me show you how to fix that this is the final step that separates position 7 from position one or two and most agencies completely skip it because they don't understand how Google's trust algorithm works and here's what's going on you can have perfect GBP optimization 25 pages of perfect content everything structured correctly but without external links without external votes of trust Google cats you you won't rank in the top three unless you're playing in a tiny market i've seen this happen dozens of times that plumber in Plano we got him to position 12 with categories and services now he stayed stuck there for a little bit until we added the local links then that's what jumped him to position 2.35 same everything else just added the external validation that Google needs google's map algorithm is based on three things proximity relevance and authority now we can't do anything about proximity relevance is already handled by the content you just generated and authority that's just a fancy way of saying links without external validation from local websites Google sees your 25 pages as a low trust content and won't rank you in the top three i'm going to show you a prompt that we use almost every day it binds every link opportunity in your local city in less than 5 minutes now when you run this prompt you're going to receive a massive list of possible links categorized by type chambers of commerce local sponsorship business directories local media schools government sites it prioritizes them based on authority and effort required start with your local chamber of commerce join it that's the first thing you should do and it's usually one of the most powerful links you can source for a local business then start looking for sponsorship opportunities youth sports teams local charities community events these cost money but they're well worth it for that plumber in Plano we got around five local links for about $1,000 total we joined two chambers of commerce you don't need to limit yourself to just one did a youth softball team sponsorship and a couple of local events five links that's all it took to get them from position 12 to position two once we had the content developed after you secure those quality local links wait a few weeks google needs time to crawl those links and update your rankings but once it does you're going to see movement now at this point in this process you have everything set up to rank categories services content external links you're probably in the top five if you're following along unless you're in like Houston or New York City or something you might even be in the top three but here's what keeps you there consistent activity on your GBP because if Google sees your GBP go silent your rankings usually start slipping so here's what most businesses do they're going to post once when they remember maybe twice a month if they're really motivated then three months go by rankings start dropping and they have no idea why google wants to see regular activity on your GVP businesses that post weekly rank higher than businesses that don't it really is just that simple but honestly posting every week is a pain you have to come up with ideas write the content find images schedule it most business owners honestly just don't do it because they forget and it's just too much work so instead automate it i'm going to show you a single prompt that will generate 52 posts an entire year of content with weekly posts in a couple of minutes schedule them all at once using a GBP management tool lead Snap is the one that we use at my agency and then set them to repeat annually and you're done you have content forever gbp posts once a week forever now when you run this prompt it's going to generate four types of posts: promotional educational engagement and seasonal they're distributed evenly across the year so you're not hitting people with sales pitches every single week some posts offer tips some showcase customer stories some tie to holidays or other local events so after you generate the 52 posts read through them again we don't post things that AI wrote without reading it please everyone stop posting things that AI wrote without reading it okay add specific business details adjust the tone if you need to and use GBP management tool like lead snap or knit another one or just do it manually to post once a week and that's it you just automated at least a year of GBP activity in under an hour now here's a situation you're going to run into you get a new client or maybe it's you and they already have a website with dozens of pages maybe hundreds now they don't want to rebuild everything from scratch they just want to know what's missing what needs to be fixed and what can be repurposed that's exactly what this diagnostic prompt does it takes their existing site crawls it with Screaming Frog that's a technical SEO tool and cross-ch checkcks it against their GBP categories and services then it tells you exactly what gaps exist say you have a plumber that already has 80 pages of content you're going to run this prompt and it's going to tell you that they're missing dedicated pages for eight of their GVP services but 10 of their GVP services there's existing content they just need to update the title tag or H1 tag maybe it's the water heater installation page that exists but the title tag doesn't include the city name three category pages aren't linking to their service pages google won't be able to crawl those connections if you don't have the internal links so instead of guessing what to create or rebuild this will give you a prioritized list fix these title tags fix these internal links create missing pages that it identifies and you'll save yourself weeks of auditing and give the client a very clear road map on your path forward so this prompt takes your screaming frog data like I mentioned it's a technical SEO tool that crawls any website and analyzes against the GBP categories and services it's going to find most of the gaps missing pages wrong title tags broken links services that are mentioned on category pages everything but remember AI tends to hallucinate and lie and make things up so yet again make sure you double check it to run this prompt you're going to need to download Screaming Frog it's free for websites under 500 URLs run the crawl export the links all CSV and the internal all CSV give that data along with the GBP categories and services and run the AI will give you the bulleted list of what's missing or broken it'll take you 5 minutes but save you hours of manual auditing we run this at my agency on every single new client before we do any work it gives us a great idea of what needs to be created what needs to be fixed and what's already working you can also run it quarterly on existing clients to catch existing problems before they hurt rankings now this one prompt has saved me more time in client audits than most any other tool instead of manually checking you get the complete analysis in 5 minutes and you're ready to start double-checking it now all six of these prompts the five main ones I gave you plus that bonus prompt are in my school community the link is in the description below i've also included a guide for setting up Screaming Frog and how to run that prompt with video walkthroughs showing you exactly what to do and how to doublech checkck the outputs so that complete system from GBP optimization all the way to service pages and ongoing maintenance everything you need to rank in the top three and generate consistent leads now you can follow this entire system perfectly and still tank your rankings if you're stuck listening to traditional SEO advice most of what you've been taught about SEO is outdated wrong or actively hurt your results so in this next video I'm going to expose everything you think you know about SEO that's actually killing your rankings
