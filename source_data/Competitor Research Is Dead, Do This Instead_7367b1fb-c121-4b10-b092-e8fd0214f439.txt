TITLE: Competitor Research Is Dead, Do This Instead
ID: 7367b1fb-c121-4b10-b092-e8fd0214f439

if you're trying to rank on Google and you start with competitor research you've already lost most people waste weeks pulling reports from AHFS or Semrush and trying to copy backlink strategies that don't tell them a single actionable thing about why their competitor is actually winning so in this video I'm going to show you what Google actually rewards i'm going to show you how to diagnose exactly what your site needs right now and I'm going to give you the three paths that tell you exactly what you need to build to beat your competitors this is the exact framework I've used to rank over 200 businesses and scale my agency to seven figures so let's start with the one thing that Google rewards above everything else google's algorithm doesn't really care about how many backlinks the site has nearly as much as you think it does it really cares about one thing goal completion does the user get what they came for did the user solve their problem this is the universal truth of SEO and how Google's algorithm works whether you're running a national e-commerce brand a massive blog or a plumbing shop in Plano Texas Google wins when the user stops searching if they search for a term click on your link and then never go back to Google to click another result you win that's the only signal that Google really cares about but here's where we have to niche down because goal completion looks completely different depending on the game you're playing for a blog or a news site goal completion usually means consumption the user reads the article they stay on the page for a little bit maybe they scroll down to the bottom but fundamentally they don't go back to the search results for a local business the goal is action did they click to call did they hit the get directions button when they called did you answer the phone and Google knows the answer to those questions better than anyone else do you think they produced Chrome and Android and gave them out for free out of the goodness of their heart of course not they spent billions building those free tools for one reason to track user behavior and make their search algorithm better they know exactly when someone finds the answer they know exactly when someone clicks to call they know if you answered the phone and here is why traditional competitor research fails when you fire up AHFS or Semrush you're looking at vanity metrics you can see their backlinks you can see their estimated traffic but you can't see the data that actually matters no tool can show you click-through rate phone calls generated phone calls answered how well those websites are doing at goal completion you can't see how many people start calling the other businesses after calling that business you're trying to reverse engineer their success while missing the most important part of why they're ranked where they are you're making decisions based on an incomplete map this is why I tell people to completely ignore domain rating or domain authority for local SEO i see this every single day a local plumber has a domain rating of five and they're absolutely crushing a national directory with a domain rating of 80 inside the map pack why because that high domain rating site has zero local relevance it's a generic page trying to rank everywhere the low DR site is hyperfocused on that specific city and that specific service for local SEO local relevance beats raw authority almost every single time so if you can't rely on third party metrics and you can't see the data Google sees what do you actually do step one is to stop guessing and run a proper local rank map don't just Google plumber near me from your phone that tells you absolutely nothing about how well that business is ranking three miles down the road you need to see the truth across the entire service area at my agency we use a tool called Lead Snap to run a grid search for primary keywords i'm going to drop a link in the description that gives you half off for your first three months if you want to try that tool out there are plenty of other tools that run grid searches also the goal you want to use this to see green dots where you're winning and the red dots where you're invisible let me show you a quick example so this is an example of a local rank map and if we look at this we can see if I searched for window cleaning and I was standing right where the business is I would show in the top three and I'd be super happy about being in the top three but if I go anywhere else and do that same search we can see that I'm nowhere to be found remember fourth position is completely invisible to see the fourth position you need to click more businesses which no one ever does so a rank map like this reveals exactly where your authority falls off the cliff this is something a manual spot check is never going to show you so once you have this map step two is to size up the fight now most people skip this they just assume that the competitor is ranking because of magic or secret backlinks but usually the competitors are ranking because they have a bigger foundation and excellent goal completion and we can check the foundation here's how it's simple and it's free let me show you okay so I'm going to go ahead and start by typing in plumbers in Gary Indiana and I'm going to do something no one ever does i'm going to hit more places and I'm just going to look for one to check here i I usually like checking ones that have solid reviews but they're not in the top three so we'll do What do we have here we have 700 reviews 69 with a terrible overall rating and 22 reviews let's grab Green Piping Systems they have 45 reviews so Green Piping Systems LLC and then I'm going to go on over to Lead Snap i'm going to go to new and I'm going to type in Green Piping Systems LLC and see if we can find it as a quick side note LLC should not be in your GBP business name google specifically says not to include LLC in there okay so here we go and then uh this is their rank map and I can size this however I want to and I can move that dot over there if I want to so I can make this a little bit wider all right that's fine so keywords and we'll do plumber Gary and we'll run that scan while this is running I heard that the Chicago Bears are moving to Indiana i think it would be absolutely fabulous if they changed their name to the Gary Bears just that would just be delightful for me so while this is still going we'll double check what we're after here to see the foundation we did see Green Piping System was ranked pretty low so let's see how big their website is so the way we do that we hit site and then paste their domain in with no space we'll hit enter and then we'll do that with their top three competitors i'll remove this UTM tracking site website site website and site website okay now our green pipe uh they have four indexed results young plumbing has 179 AJ the plumber has five and Westgate plumbing services have 173 what we're doing here this shows you exactly how many URLs Google has indexed for this website if their two competitors have 200 index pages about plumbing and you have four you don't have a backlink problem you have a relevance problem and we can see that our chosen plumber Green Piping Systems they have exactly four indexed URLs against two competitors with 175 or so and look at the rank map it's still pretty good what this means is that they made relatively small changes to their website added a few more pages to bring some additional relevance we can see even if we look at the homepage that we're not it's just not a very good website uh and there's a variety of reasons why I'm saying that we're missing the GBP embed the title tag is wrong we're missing social proof we're missing the GBP reviews we're missing content about the primary category the secondary categories we're missing content about the core services uh the H1 primary heading is incorrect there are a lot of things here on top of the fact that their website is just too small if they fix these things which could be done for less than $1,000 probably less than a few hundred I would expect this rank map to look a lot better very quickly if Green Piping Systems LLC is watching this there's a real opportunity here for them now there is one caveat here if you see a website that has hundreds and hundreds of pages then we might want to check the index and make sure that they haven't spent the last 3 years writing weekly blog posts about five ways to maintain your water heater those can be safely ignored they're fluff they do not add to local relevance but if they have 200 pages of specific services and specific locations this simple comparison tells you more than any domain rating score ever could it tells you how much topical authority this competitor website has been able to build now based on what the map and the index count tell you you're going to fall into one of three diagnostic paths path one is a topical relevance issue this shows up in two potential ways either your ranking for the primary category is basically non-existent or and this is the one that tricks people you have a decent map ranking for the primary category like plumber but you're completely invisible for the high margin specific services like water heater replacement or main drain line replacement you check the competitor's index and they have 20 pages dedicated to water heaters and you have one paragraph on your services page this tells you you don't need links you need depth so how do we do that how do we check a competitor's index for how much content they have about water heaters let me show you so we'll go over to youngplumbing.com and remember this is telling Google I only want to see results on this domain and then we'll just put in water heater and again we can see 83 results so Young Plumbing has 83 pages of content that mention water heater we can do the same check on this competitor that had 177 pages and they only had three so based on this we can see that Young Plumbing has a lot more water heater content than Westgate Plumbing so if I rerun this rank map for water heater replacement I'm still just thinking about the Gary Bears man i mean that would be Man I I hope it happens i hope it happens it It's sad for people in Chicago who lose the Bears but man the Gary Bears how cool would that be so the rank map has filled in and look at this this is positive news for this plumber they're not ranking particularly well for plumber but they are ranking well for water heater replacement now most plumbers care more about ranking for water heater replacement than they do ranking for plumber because this is a high margin search term what this tells me is that not very many plumbers in Gary Indiana are hyperfocused on trying to rank for water heater replacement so Green Piping Systems has fallen in to the fact that they can rank for it because there's less competition for this service than there is for the service of plumber so again if they wanted to improve this and rank even higher it's really just a matter of creating more content and creating more relevance about water heater replacement just for fun let's see how many times water heater is mentioned on their website one one mention and their rank map looks this good imagine what the rank map would look like if they had 10 mentions and this is where most people get this wrong they're going to try to fix this by downloading a list of high volume keywords from ah refs but I have an entire video on this channel where I break down exactly why keyword research is basically dead if you want proof on why those old methods fail for keyword research go watch that video but for this diagnosis you need to understand one thing google matches entities not strings of text it matches concepts so instead of guessing we're going to steal Google's homework using AI now I can take the content from the top three ranking competitors and feed it into Claude or ChatgPT then I can use a very specific prompt i'm going to go ahead and put the prompt on the screen right now so you can screenshot it and use it yourself but I also have it available to copy paste in my school community link in the description now if you run this prompt it won't just give you water heater repair it's going to give you thermouple and pilot light anode rod expansion tank sediment flush these are entities that prove to Google and other AI models that you are an expert that you know what you're talking about i had a client in Plano Texas a plumber and we use this exact method we didn't just write blog posts about fixing water heaters that doesn't work we built pages that covered every single entity related to that system within a couple months he wasn't just ranking for plumber though he absolutely was he was dominating for every high ticket variation because our entity topical map was complete okay so path two is geographical relevance this is the most common issue I see this is when your map is green on top of your office but turns red as you get four or five miles away this tells me that you have trust google knows who you are knows your business entity and it trusts that your business entity does plumbing but it doesn't see you as relevant to the neighbors next door now the fix here is to not spam city name keywords on your homepage that really doesn't work it stopped working years ago and in August of 2025 Google rolled out an update making that count as actual spam don't do spam google doesn't like it instead we want to focus on this neighborhood overlay strategy so we're going to go to the map which I have open here for green piping systems and we're going to zoom in until we see geographic landmarks appear not cities but the districts the neighborhoods the subdivisions the parks the lakes the city buildings because Lead Snap uses a Google Map interface it's already overlaid on Google Maps if your map tool doesn't use Google Maps you're going to want to overlay this on Google Maps because we want to look at geographical landmarks that Google recognizes the way to make sure Google recognizes the geographic landmark is to use Google Maps you guessed it and then we're going to look for fours and fives and sixes these are dots that we can much more easily turn into a three if we turn a four into a three that's 10 times 50 times the amount of traffic if we turn a 15 into a four that's roughly the same amount of traffic that is zero let me show you what I mean so I'll zoom in here uh and if I'm looking at these fours and fives I can see Willow Creek i can see Portage i can see Lake Station i can see the intersection of 90 and 94 these are all geographical landmarks so what we're going to do is build a specific page on the website for that neighborhood or landmark we're not just going to swap the city name and publish the same generic content we're going to write new content hyperfocused on that landmark on that specific local geography so the target keyword for that page is going to follow a specific format it's going to be the service near the landmark in the city so in this case it might be water heater replacement near the intersection of 90 and 94 in Gary now when we did this for a client in Houston we didn't just target Houston we built pages for the Heights for the River Oaks for the 610 Loop for I 10 West for the Houston Aquarium we referenced local elements local landmarks that proved we actually knew the area and we served that area and the result if you do this you turn these yellow dots green one at a time okay the third path is restructure this is the hardest pill to swallow this is when you look at the competitor's structure versus yours and you realize that you've crammed 10 different services onto a single page while they have a dedicated interlink silo for every single one if your site is a flat mess of five pages and they have a structured hierarchy of 200 it's going to be very hard to optimize your way out of that hole now I hate deleting content that's already indexed i hate deleting content that is ranking so we don't have to completely nuke the site we do have to reorganize it you're going to want to take your mess and move it to a structure where your homepage links to your service and your secondary category pages which then link to specific service pages below those category pages or subservices under the service pages this creates a clear silo of authority that flows through your entire site mimic the exact structure that your GBP has it can be painful to reorganize but this is the only way to compete with giants who have built a proper library of content so this is why traditional competitor research is useless for local SEO most people will nail the diagnosis they see the red dots but then they freeze they know they need topical relevance but now what do you build 50 service pages do you write blog posts first what actually moves the needle so in this next video I'm going to break down my exact ranking process what I build first how I structure the content and the exact order that I build everything in so click on that video before you touch another client's site
