 In Washington State, these are defined as one half hour before sunrise until one half hour after sunset. Make sure you verify daylight hours in each state in which you will be operating.

Deflection: 

The amount the tip of the high pole bends while traveling at high speed.

Divided/undivided highway: 

A divided highway is one where the lanes going in opposite directions are divided by a barrier (usually either a concrete barrier or a median strip). An undivided highway is one without such a barrier, where opposing lanes are divided only by a double yellow line.

Divisible load:

 A load that can be divided into smaller sections that can be transported separately from each other.

Extra-legal vehicle:

 Any vehicle that exceeds legal dimensions and/or weights (an Oversize Load is an extra-legal vehicle).

Leapfrogging: 

When, on hilly or curvy terrain, the load must be stopped and traffic control measures put in place before proceeding.

Length:

 Trailer length is measured from the front of the cargo-carrying unit to its rear, exclusive of all overhangs from safety or energy efficiency devices. The length of a loaded trailer must include any overhangs of load.

Longer combination vehicle:

 A combination of truck tractor, semi-trailer, and trailer that exceeds legal length dimensions and operates on highways by permit for transporting reducible loads.

Lowboy: 

A type of trailer with low clearance that can accommodate taller loads. The term “lowboy” may be used to refer to a drop deck and/or Removable Goose Neck (RGN) trailer.

Multilane highway: 

A highway with two or more lanes of traffic going in each direction.

MUTCD: 

The 

Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices

, published by the Federal Highway Administration. This manual defines the national standards for traffic control devices.

Nighttime hours:

 In Washington State, these are defined as one half hour after sunset to one half hour before sunrise. Make sure you verify daylight hours in each state in which you will be operating.

Non-divisible load:

 Any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits that, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would either compromise the intended use of the vehicle, destroy the value of the load or vehicle, or require more than eight work hours to dismantle using appropriate equipment.

A vehicle that does not require a permit to operate.

OSHA: 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration

. The division of the U.S. government that regulates safety and health in workplaces.

Pilot/Escort or P/E vehicle:

Tillerman: 

An individual who is physically located on the trailer, steering the rear axles of a Commercial Motor Vehicle at highway speeds.

Traffic Control Plan (TCP):

 Depicts the route and specific procedures to be followed to provide safe movement along the route, including lane restrictions, use of flaggers, etc. A TCP is typically needed for Superloads. However, local jurisdictions might also require them for other loads.

Oversize Load Bridge Hits: A growing problem with one simple solution.

When a vehicle or its load is too large to pass under a bridge, a bridge strike occurs. These strikes, or hits, result in millions of dollars in infrastructure damage each year and can be hazardous—even fatal—for those responsible for the collision, other drivers on the road, or bystanders. 

7 Steps to Starting Your Pilot Car Career

I see a lot of people asking about becoming pilot drivers, so I thought I’d share the journey I took to get here. This path isn’t easy, and I’ve picked up some valuable lessons along the way. Here’s what worked for me—and what new pilots should be prepared for in this industry.

Where in the U.S. can I use my Washington State pilot car certification?

Pilot/Escort Vehicle Operator Certification

Pilot/Escort vehicles, also known as pilot cars, escort vehicles, flag cars, and chase cars, accompany Oversize Loads to help protect them and others on the road during transport. They play a critical role in protecting lives and preventing costly accidents.

5 Steps to Preventing Bridge Hits

A bridge hit happens when a load is too large to fit under a structure, and part of the load strikes the bridge. A study of bridge hits in the last decade found that the average cost of a bridge strike is approximately $300,000 in infrastructure and property damage claims. When including the cost of route obstructions, injuries, fatalities and other losses, the cost of bridge strikes increases significantly.*

High Pole Basics

Depending on the height of the load, the front PEVO may need to run with a high pole. A high pole is a measuring device, mounted on the front of the lead vehicle, that is used to measure the height of obstructions along the route. The use of a high pole may be mandated on the permit(s). But even in cases where it is not required by the permitting agency, the carrier or transport team may decide that it is a good idea to run with a high pole in order to ensure the safety of the load.

Pilot Car Certification Test Preparation Guide

Although your PEVO course will cover all of the information you will be expected to know on the exam, we still have students ask if they can take a “pre-test,” or sample test, so they are familiar with the format and types of questions they’ll be asked. The following sample questions may give you an idea of what to expect from the exam.

Railroad safety for Oversize Loads

Collisions between trains and Oversize Loads are more common than you think. If your permitted route takes you over railroad tracks, including urban light rail crossings, your team will need to assess them and plan ahead in order to stay safe.

Pilot/Escort Vehicle Insurance

Many PEVOs who have realized the importance of insurance have had the unfortunate experience of being sold insurance that is not adequate to cover activities performed as a PEVO.

PEVO equipment and supplies

New pilot/escort vehicle operators (PEVOs) are responsible for acquiring their own equipment, unless supplied by an employer. The following supplies are recommended by Evergreen Safety Council, based on our Pilot/Escort Vehicle Operator Certification curriculum and the recommendations of the National Pilot Car Association. Please keep in mind that your state or jurisdiction may have additional requirements.

Every move begins with a pre-trip meeting

It takes teamwork, communication, to help ensure that the load you’re moving reaches its destination without incident. That’s why every Oversize Load move must begin with a pre-trip meeting.
