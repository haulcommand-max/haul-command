ID: d084e184-b2aa-4952-9b8b-7cffc90697f3

every Google AI tool explained in 8 minutes google just dropped like 30 AI tools and everyone's confused which one do you actually use i'm going to show you the exact system I use to pick the right tool no fluff no confusion just the stuff that actually works okay so here's the problem google doesn't have an AI problem you do there's like 50 tools now new stuff drops every week and nobody tells you which one to actually use so you end up collecting tools like Pokémon cards but you never use any of them today I'm fixing that i'm going to give you a simple decision system three questions that's it and once you know these three questions you'll never waste time on the wrong tool again let me show you every time Google drops a new AI tool I ask three questions question one does this replace thinking replace work or replace time question two will I use this weekly not someday question three does it connect to tools I already use if the tool fails two out of three I ignore it this instantly eliminates 70% of tools you're left with the stuff that actually matters and I'm going to walk you through real scenarios so you see exactly how this works stick with me because by the end you'll have a system that saves you hours every single week let's say you're doing research you've got 10 PDFs five blog posts three competitor websites and you need to make a decision fast you could read everything that takes hours or you could use Google's deep research AI here's what I'd do i'd feed it all the sources then I'd say "Compare these three competitors tell me what AI Profit Boardroom does better what we're missing and what features members actually want based on these reviews." Boom in 5 minutes you get a full breakdown it handles massive context it's better at synthesis than chat GPT for this kind of stuff this replaces thinking time not creativity and that's exactly what you want for research i use this weekly it connects to my workflow that's three out of three this tool stays now let's talk about documents you got notes everywhere PDFs you downloaded recordings from meetings all sitting there doing nothing here's where source grounded document AI comes in this isn't a chatbot it's a translator for your knowledge here's an example let's say I have a 50-page PDF about automation strategies i upload it then I say "Turn this into a one-page cheat sheet for AI Profit Boardroom members on how to automate their client on boarding using AI." It pulls from the source no hallucinations no madeup stuff just clean output based on what you gave it you can also turn it into study guides podcasts briefing docs email sequences whatever you need and because it's grounded in your source you control the truth this is huge i use this all the time to turn messy research into usable content three out of three again keeper real quick if you're watching this and thinking okay this is cool but how do I actually implement this stuff in my business that's exactly why we built AI Profit Boardroom inside you'll learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like the ones I'm showing you today we've got members automating their marketing their sales their entire back end and they're doing it without writing a single line of code if that sounds useful check the link in the description all right back to the video here's the next one repetitive work you're saving files to the same folder sorting emails generating the same summary every Monday it's not hard work but it's annoying and it eats your mental energy this is where visual automation builders come in if you can draw a flowchart you can automate here's a real example every time someone joins AI Profit Boardroom I want to send them a welcome email add them to a spreadsheet tag them in my CRM and send their info to Slack i can build that in 10 minutes no coding just drag and drop and here's the key insight automation isn't about scale it's about mental relief i don't care if I save 2 hours a week i care that I never have to think about that task again that's the real value this one's a three out of three for anyone doing repetitive tasks this one's underrated most people use AI like this they type a prompt wait read the output type another prompt wait again that's not saving time that's just different work here's the better way give AI a task walk away come back later this is async AI and it's a gamecher example let's say I need to debug some code for a new feature in AI profit boardroom instead of sitting there watching it work I give it the task then I go record a video or take a call when I come back it's done this is how AI actually saves time not constant prompting not babysitting just give it work and let it run this changes everything for coding long processing jobs data analysis anything that takes time if you do technical work this is a mustave all right let's talk visuals you need graphics you need ads you need social content but you're not a designer and hiring someone takes days here's where AI image and video tools shine let me break this into three parts part one consistent images let's say AI profit boardroom needs a mascot a robot character that appears in all our content i create it once then I reuse it everywhere emails thumbnails social posts this is huge for branding part two short video creation i can type "Create a 15-second ad for AI profit boardroom showing someone automating their email marketing with AI upbeat music modern style." Boom ai gives me a video with motion and audio is it perfect no but it's good enough for testing and that's the point part three rapid concept testing i can generate 10 logo ideas in 5 minutes pick one polish it later ai is best at exploration not perfection use it to test ideas fast then refine the winner this saves days of back and forth with designers three out of three if you create content last scenario you want to build something maybe a little tool maybe a prototype but you're not a developer this is where AI playgrounds and studios come in these are not for building full SAS apps they're for experiments for testing for learning how AI behaves example let's say I want to test a new AI chatbot for AI profit boardroom that answers member questions i can build a quick version in 30 minutes test it see if it works then decide if it's worth building properly this is perfect for founders and creators you get to prototype fast without hiring engineers just to see if your idea has legs if you're building this is gold okay here's the big mistake I see tool collecting people download every new AI tool but they never master anything here's the reframe the advantage isn't knowing 30 tools is mastering three workflows what are the three worth mastering one research two knowledge conversion three automation master those three and you're ahead of 99% of people stop collecting start using QuickNote on Google Labs think of it as Google's public beta brain they test stuff there before it goes mainstream why should you care early access you get to see trends before everyone else but here's the catch don't build your business on it yet labs tools can disappear they can change use them to experiment not to run critical workflows that's the smart play here's something wild you're already using Google AI you just don't realize it it's in Gmail in Docs in Sheets in maps in photos everywhere and here's the insight the biggest upgrade isn't new tools it's how you use existing ones most people ignore the AI features already in their daily apps that's where the lowhanging fruit is go turn on smart replies in Gmail use auto organizing photos try suggested formulas and sheets you'll save hours without learning anything new all right let me give you my stack one research tool deep research AI one document tool source grounded document AI one automation tool visual automation builder one creative tool image and video generator everything else is optional that's it four tools not 30 and here's the truth the people winning with AI aren't early adopters they're selective adopters they pick what works they ignore the rest and they master their workflow that's the game all right if you want the full process SOPs and 100 plus AI use cases like the ones I just showed you join the AI success lab it's our free AI community links in the comments and description you'll get all the video notes from there plus access to our community of 40,000 members who are crushing it with AI and if you want to go deeper and actually implement this stuff in your business with our help check out AI Profit Boardroom we'll show you exactly how to save time and automate your business with AI tools no guessing just systems that work links are below thanks for watching i'll see you in the next
