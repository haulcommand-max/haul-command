ID: 2bff8876-3fee-4cae-893d-d1fa865ad4e5

google's anti-gravity is a gamechanging AI coding tool if you know how to use it most people are using just a fraction of its potential but in this video I'm going to show you the hidden systems that let you build apps way better than your competitors 10 times as quickly even if you've never coded before and if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts i built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a sevenfigure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in anti-gravity is powered by the brand new incredible Gemini 3 but also it's got access to the latest Claude Code models you can build anything like AI apps and dashboards and websites and even manage your entire team with long-term memory and build personal productivity systems it is very cool but most people just use it as a chatbot and leave most of the value on the table now this is best explained by building an app together and not only am I going to show you how you build an app I'm going to show you across a very clear fourstep wraps framework which will basically mean that not only can we develop these apps you're going to be able to build it faster at a higher quality and you're not even going to need make.com or anything it can run completely by itself now imagine that you and I have the world's fastest Formula 1 car and the world's best driver but they have no idea where they're racing which track they're on or any information about the conditions the chances are they're not going to perform to the highest level which is why the first level in our fourstep framework stands for Rules and rules is a really important one to understand here so if you haven't already you would download anti-gravity for MacOSS at this website and when you do you're going to be able to open up and this by the way is a part two to a full breakdown I did previously it's going to build on those systems to get you way further ahead now I've created a project here we've called it Reddit Scraper if you haven't done that come down to open folder create a brand new folder here open it and you'll have this now these rules actually exist across three levels but the rules are not just going to govern how this project works but how every project we ever do in the future works and that's best illustrated by an example so the first thing I'm going to say to this is "Hey there I want you to create for me a product design document for a very simple interactive website that will display the top six results from the nat subreddit take create that as a document on the left hand side called productdesign.mmd." Okay cool so here's the thing i'm asking it to create something now now I want to talk a bit about rules that exist on three different levels so we have on the left hand side are going to be specific rules within the folders so you're going to have various different things in there and Gemini will create those rules but here's a really interesting one we have over here you can see if we come down here to customizations we can create rules here this is going to be where we can create rules that will govern the project and rules that will govern our global use of anti-gravity really really really important so one of the things I want you to look at and obviously as we know anti-gravity when you're asking it questions it will come up with these task list which can comment and we can say is this fine i might just say this looks great i might even just say something like add notes on design okay beautiful so if I'm going to come over here and grab this thing for you here you can see I took this from my school community this anti-gravity global rules overview so the first sets of rules I want you to think about are global rules this applies to every single project you ever do with anti-gravity the four that I found really helpful are persona so being specific about how you want anti-graft to behave hex stack and default so if you always want to build in a certain way style and communication what defines done and what doesn't define done like is done when you've given it a certain level of approval you can really hardcode these at the highest level and that'll be called the project setup which I'll come on to soon to plan MD so all we're going to do is actually copy this information come back over to anti-gravity and you're going to specify in the global section all the things that you want anti-gravity to do in all projects what I find best here is how you want it to behave you want it to check you want it to iterate through various different things it's building things now to do this all you do is come down here on the right hand side and click on add in workspace now when you come back over to anti-gravity I want you to click these dots up here and click on customizations and you can see two things rules and workflows rules here you can see this basically controls these are the master instructions for Gemini md which means whenever you're using this at any time it will have this as its DNA this is like what's written on the back of its head basically so you can have all of your specifics that exist within Gemini MD so I encourage you to paste those instructions there then what we have is workflows so these are specific things that we can add in like this debugging workflow here which is if at any point I want my agent to go and debug something cuz it's not working i can just say for slash or at basically this workflow and it will follow all of the specific instructions think of them kind of like quasi skills in a way then under the rules section what we can always do here is add in rules either globally which is the highest level for Gemini or we can do it on a workspace stuff so I might say if I'm building something for let's say a design agency I could say these are my design agency rules and I could say look basically only specifically within this project use these specific rules now we've got this actual product design thing here that we're happy with what we're going to do is actually start to build the balloon so we're going to say "Hey there I'd like to go ahead and build the below please." Fantastic and then we're going to paste some stuff like that uh and then we want to give it a little bit of design inspiration so I've just jumped over to my school community to grab some information from these gorgeous UI dashboards and what we can do is find any kind of information or specifics that we think they're really cool and we can grab and capture those images and share it as a mood board actually within anti-gravity so say for example we really love the style of this what you would do is basically capture screenshots for a couple of different things like so you can come back over save that to clipboard save it to your desktop then come back over to anti-gravity and then anti-gravity we can create a new folder and we can call this one something like design inspo beautiful and then what we can do in design inspo is just drop everything we want there okay so come down drop the files very very cool and you can see now that it can read and understand that and then what we can say down here is say I'd like to use some of the design references within the design info folder to actually create what the look and feel and design of this thing is fantastic okay then we click submit and then anti-gravity build out the very first iteration of our application and so one such an example of a tool that I would really like this to follow is going to be this audit thing which essentially is when it creates an app it's a really cool checklist that it can go through and basically sense check if the design makes sense it's visually good that it works that you can open up in a different file we have here recursive selfcorrection loops if it's not working it will actually do all of this stuff for us without us constantly having to basically prompt it to do that so when you come back over to anti-gravity if I click on these buttons here for example I click on customizations I can create a workflow for this so I come down and let's say I want a global workflow this is something that I want to do all the time and all I would do is call this one audit which is great and then I just simply pop in all the stuff I wanted to do on the audit and I can say this is an audit to make sure that every app is functional and looks great and you can create these mini little things like that and we come down here click file click save and essentially we've now got this fantastic audit that we can use once we've built these actual systems and as you can see anti-gravity is now coming back and asking for our permission based on all the things asked us little tip by the way in anti-gravity if you come up here click on anti-gravity click on settings anti-gravity settings you'll be able to basically determine in this browser here all the stuff you want to do so for example review policy artifacts always proceed agent decides request review terminal for it's running things on your computer what do you want to do the best advice I've generally found with this stuff is make sure you're doing the auditing initially and then when you get more comfortable with specific things you can let it just run and do what it needs to do once you're happy with that and you can do this based on the browser based on the editor based on the agent as and so you're sort of comfortable as you go so we come down and we accept all the changes here now as you'll remember in anti-gravity we have this browser here we're talking about but you can also click if you come up to the top and I'll bring this down so you can see it really well is we have agent manager now you remember agent manager here is basically our universal area think of it like your command UI where you have all your projects on the left hand side and what we can do here is create multiple parallel agents as we go through we do various different things i'm going to show you all of that in great detail with some things that you've probably not seen before actually but before we can do that there's one thing that we really have to crack down and understand now imagine having the world's fastest Formula 1 engine in Gemini in this incredible application we've got but imagine you have no car chassis you have no wheels you don't have the tools to actually get to where you need to and that is exactly what the second stage here in our fourstep framework is which stands for armory in other words the weaponry and the tools and the systems that you can connect to anti-gravity and an anti-gravity is context we call these MCPs so if I come over and just show you these for example MCP servers effectively think of them as a way to connect your anti-gravity this entire incredible thing to so many different applications there are five or six that you're going to use all the time and when you make those connections you're essentially able to do anything that you want to now here's a way that you'd think about them essentially on the right hand side in your MCP store MCP just being how we connect things to other things you can literally search them so for example you can search for something called Superbase and so for example when you actually connect it to something like Superbase we no longer have to go through loads of crazy pasting copy and pasting and SQL editor we can literally just talk to anti-gravity in natural language and it will do everything for us automatically that is how powerful this stuff is we can ask it questions in natural language about our business our trend lines it's insane so the MTP service that I really want you to click into are the following so there's a couple that you'll use a lot for various different situations that will cover you for like 90% of the things that you're going to do so context 7 is a really really important one so you're going to be able to first of all grab the ones that you need on the right hand side but if they're not available all you ever do is literally come through to your language model of choice could be chat GPT for example and you're going to say "Hey grab me the MCP code for context 7 whatever the thing is." is okay we hit that one in there and it will grab you that specific code and you can just add that in to your anti-gravity scenario just like this dead simple or you can even come over to the agent itself and say "Hey grab me the code hey I want to integrate with Context 7 could you grab me the MCP config for that please?" Bam and I'd say I will give you the API key all right dead straightforward then all you would ever do is come over then to context 7.com and grab that now contact 7 is great because it has the most up-to-date documents for LLM and code editors which essentially means whenever you want to use his APIs you're always using the latest greatest thing which is freaking awesome so that's how we can grab that it's very cool gemini will help us with that directly the other ones that you really want to have a look at MCP servers guys if we come down here and show you is firecrawl is incredible now firecrawl is another one we're going to manually add but the fire crawl API lets us basically chat to websites so essentially with firecrawl what we can do and I'll even show you this let's just say for example I've got this grind.co.uk coffee okay which is a random website what if I want to ask it a question but I'm not really sure where on the website it is right so let's just say there's something under accessories here right really wild under brewing equipment okay something that I wouldn't necessarily know from the homepage but it's quite relevant so look at this coffee pod machine Christmas decoration okay if I want to know how much that costs check this out i can come back over because I've enabled the fire crawl MCP and if I click on this you can see it's got so many different functions it will let me scrape it will let me search it will let me do anything here firecrawl search crawl check the status these are things that you're going to use all of the time so what I can do here is lally come over to the agent manager i can open up I can do this in the sandbox as well this doesn't even need to be in the kind of main file so I can click on playground and I can say something like "Hey there dude i want you to use the firecrawl mcp could you just go over to grind.co.uk UK and tell me how much this particular fridge magnet costs okay and what was the actual fridge magnet called it was called the coffee pod machine Christmas okay bam whatever the thing is now this can actually go ahead and use the fire crawl MCP for us whenever we want to now here's a cool thing when you have these MCPs connected in your anti-gravity instance what that and look at this it's using the MCP tool it can use it to its fullest extent so this lets you get levels of data and information on websites that are completely next level this does the search and it will return the information to us and then once it's finished it process it comes down it finds what it looks like it's got the coffee pod machine Christmas decoration i open this up and this should be the exact one that we were looking at and it literally is right there you can see it's the same one and it's found that for us instantaneously meaning that you can chat with websites which is crazy and then the other ones that you want to add in here I find a is superbase superbase is going to be our incredible database that lets us basically connect anything get all the numbers we can add in any information databases people creating accounts it could be your financial forecast it could be the numbers for your life whatever it is what you can do with the Superbase MTP is it can create tables it can do essentially anything you want to and the connection for it is really straightforward and simple you literally just type in Superbase on the right hand side it'll pop up you click up and it will open a brand new page you grab the code to integrate it and then you'll be ready to rock and roll and that's managed here in the superbase access token you literally click it and you can see it opens up and then you just create a brand new access token to rock and roll so this is going to give you the data side of things and then the other couple of MCP servers that are going to be great for you one is going to be notion so this is your ability to actually get it to create and do anything you want to in notion so it can change your actions it can like create SOPs it can do literally anything that you want to once you connect it to notion and basically connects to all your project management stuff and then you've got Pine Cone pine Cone is your ability to store long-term data so you can upload contracts and calls from 9 10 12 months ago on the left hand side and that will all get stored for you in Pine Cone that's how incredible that is it literally is game changing the Pine Cone integration is so for example when you connect to notion I could say "Hey there I'd like to create me a page in Notion with some research and insights on what is the best phone to buy in January 2026 thank you whatever the specific things are that you want to do right we can have this spin up and this will create for us a brand new page in notion that we can check and it'll stay there basically as a database as knowledge that we can use anytime we want to but it's also really cool in the sense it can reach over and understand all of your to-dos so if we're building out this incredible Reddit scraper and we're working people in our team and they've added certain things in there then we can basically just change that and you can even see right now that it's even using our file crawl MCP to gather information to enrich the quality of the content that we're creating on notion and once that's complete it's now created it's done the research so we just click on this link and that will take us through to our notion page so let's come up and check this one out here all right fantastic let's get this one up as you can see best phones to buy January 2026 and it's got all the information there for us and then the other one that you're going to use a lot is this one here which is basically called Pine Cone pine Cone lets us have very long-term memory think of it it's called retrieval augmented generation i'll put a link on screen if you want to see a really great example of how you can use that we can upload contracts within the side of our our tab here and in natural language actually say to Gemini hey I want you to store this in this database for me and essentially then what this solves is the context problem cuz say for example we have like 500page document that's going to destroy your context window so what we can do instead is just upload the document on the left hand side and so for example if I upload this contract here and again this could be anything you can grab all these files that you want to vectorize from your computer and you can put them in anti-gravity and you can say something like hey I want you to go and store this contract or go and store everything in this folder into my pine cone database thank you this can then use that MCP connection to go ahead and vectorize it and effectively what that means is when we ask it a question it doesn't need to pull down all 6,000 pages it can reach over and dynamically only pull the relevant information it needs to answer the question meaning the entire process is unbelievably simple and as you can see it's now dynamically updated that to anti-gravity so if I come back over here to Pineco it's completely free to create an account you can actually see if I click on this we should have a record now for the UFC contract so I click on this and you can see it's vectorized the entire thing if you've never created it on Pine Cone before all you ever do is create index you give it a name like blank i'd recommend you choose the multilingual E5 which is basically think of it like your secretary this is like a level 10 secretary she's great at passing up into many different documents and storing it away you're going to come down all these default settings are fine and you click on create index and then you can actually just grab an API key connect it to anti-gravity using all the bits and pieces and then it will store all of your information on that and then actually within anti-gravity whenever it needs to access its long-term memory in other words say we've got like a thousandword document thousand word insurance policy we don't need to look through excuse me thousand page insurance policy we don't need to look through every page we can just pull down the relevant sections meaning that you're going to save on your context window and you have infinite long-term memory which is crazy so coming back now to this let's actually check in on how our app is going so let's ask it a really simple question like "Hey dude i'd like you to open up the app in a local host so I can check out what it's looking like thank you awesome so we're going to have a look at the specifics of this so we can see what it looks like and then we're going to see how we can then take this to another level using other features of anti-gravity that's going to help you build apps 10 times faster i can see here in this task list everything that it planned to do and everything that it completed so it's great to get those overviews at any time I want to i can shut these things down and again this is showing me all my MCPS now generally speaking you don't want the number of MCPS that you have to exceed 50 because it starts to affect your context window so what I recommend that you do is when you're not using one say for example Superbase you can click on it you can disenable it like that and it'll go away now we have our NA10 pulse which is cool and what it's done is pulled up those top six posts again I didn't ask it to build me the craziest thing ever this is just an example okay but I look at this i click on this i go to a new page do I see something on Reddit i do very cool so we have a functional thing which is hosted on our laptop in other words that it doesn't exist on the internet it's just on our desktop which is very very cool now imagine we have our Formula 1 car we got our driver we've got an incredible engine but we have five people working on it and every single one of them is all doing the same tire at the back the chances are the car's actually not going to get out there we're going to bump into each other we're going to be duplicative and make mistakes it's like having four people painting the same wall it's bound to end in disaster so what we want to do here to take this to the next level is use the third part of our raps framework which stands for parallel agents and idea with this I want you to think about it like instead of you being a violinist in a big orchestra instead you are the orchestrator you have several multiple AI agents that work for you independently all doing different tasks and if you organize these workflows properly your productivity becomes superhuman level now you'll be familiar in anti-gravity that we have our sections on the right hand side so we could if we wanted to continue to talk to this app give it design instructions give it different features go and publish it very cool but if we really want to do things faster we need to orchestrate our beautiful choir we need someone playing the violin we need someone playing piano we need somebody banging the drums maybe rattling the triangle whatever the thing is so to do that we're going to open up our agent manager so let's just come out so you can see this better if I click on agent manager which is going to be how we do all these agents I can open this guy here and everything's on the left hand side now as you may be familiar from my last video this inbox is where you manage everything so if I had 50 agents doing 50 different things all I would ever do is come down here and approve approve approve this is my universal management inbox but on the left hand side we got our Reddit scraper which is the current thing that we're building right so let's say that what we want to do is deploy parallel agents but here's the thing we don't want them all doing the same thing so how do we account for that well actually there's probably I'd say four core different archetypes of agents as a framework that I found really helpful so I'm going to come down and show you this right on the local side I split them into these four which is the design lead so I have one agent whose only job is for the visual beauty the design and the high-end UX and all you literally do anytime you want to use one of these agents is you pick which one that you want so you'd say the design lead you could have the builder whose job is to build the app build the functionality make it better we have the nerd which is for quality control and testing so this is the person that tests everything for us we have one person designing we have one agent building one agent that's doing the testing and then we can have one doing the research which is the data and the strategy and they don't interact with each other they don't overrun each other and they won't step on each other's code so what effectually what you would do is you'd pick the agent that you want so I say I want for example the design lead okay I'd come back over to anti-gravity i'd open a new thing here i'd paste in this thing here and I'd say I would like you to go through the entire application and completely redesign it to make it look as gorgeous and as interesting as humanly possible whatever the thing is give it the specifics i'm showing you this just so you can get found so I send that agent off the head go ahead and do design then I might want to come back over and let's say for example well I want to build some new functionality well I'll copy this i'll come back over and I'll be like I would like you to also scrape if I select the button the singularity subreddit add that as an additional function bam and now we can have them doing various different things independently then I might want to go ahead and get my research agent right so come down here and then I might say to this guy let's open up a new one and post this one here and say "Hey I would like you to go ahead and do comprehensive research on what the highest performing customer research tools actually do and what features do they physically have thank you." All right beautiful and we put this one in here and so now we've got multiple agents doing multiple different tasks on our particular project at the same time and then crucially you'll notice in the inbox I can manage and oversee everything i can see what all the different agents are doing the key is that you want to save time and giving it a very specific very narrowly defined task like your task is very specifically to fix this one thing so they're not overrunning with each other or competing with each other at the exact same time that's one of the key things here and you can see how all of this connects down together in your management inbox and just like guys they've all finished and you can see right now if I ask it to open up in a local host and I click on this guy you can see that they've completely redesigned it so we this nice glass morphism type of effect and vibe on it again really simplistic but the point here is that we've got it we can now search by hot new top we can add that functionality in or do essentially whatever we want to but we've now got parallel agents all working on it doing slightly different things and if I come back over for example I want to check out my customer research i can check out exactly what that looks like so you can see it's given us loads of specifics i can open up the plan have a look research and strategic plan these are everything that it wants to do hot job Microsoft clarity full story what it actually does and we get all this stuff in each of the individual agents and so now we've got a working app that for argument sake we're happy with what we could then do at this point guys is actually go ahead and do quality control to make sure it's at the right standards so let's come over to agent manager let's create a brand new agent within the Reddit subscriber again we can do any specific ones that we want to what I would then come and do is come and grab my prompt over here which is the nerd for QC testing so come over and grab this you can come back over paste it in now what we can do here very simply is click on at and type in audit like so audit the MD which is a global workflow and just for your information by the way you can do this on anything you could do this in the main chat window if I wanted to do it here I could say "Hey I want you to go ahead and audit the application to make sure it hits all the requisite principles below." And let's say I don't want to enter the requisite principles maybe I just want to do and I type in audit like so audit.md hit enter now the cool thing here is that like whatever project I'm in these global workflows are something I can just pull down grab and use and apply to literally anything and it will actually use that very specific file to make sure that it hits all of the requirements that I need on an ongoing basis a little tip guys when you do audit.md just make sure you select the one here that has the markdown and has global workflows so it's referencing the right documents and then once that's completed you can go back and forth with it to refine it to get it to the point that you're very happy with it and if I just pull this one up for instance we've got now the subreddit pulse which will pull down posts from any desired subreddit we decide to based on anything i even asked it to throw in a LinkedIn editor this if I just click on this for example I can say hey generate me a post and it can do this and do based on different factors and all this awesome stuff you can simply copy that paste it have a good time so we've basically created something now we've run it through all of the different sub aents but there's one thing that we're missing now anti-gravity is currently running on your laptop but what if we set something up for a client or our own business where we wanted it to go ahead and scrape Reddit or do something on the internet on a very regular basis but we didn't want to have to sit there and do it ourselves well the moment the second you shut your laptop down the entire thing stopped so this would be like us having an incredible Formula 1 team owning it but them not being able to ride unless we're physically there with them at the Grand Prix probably not great if you own the team right so what we want to do now is find a way to actually enable all of these scripts to run completely automatically whenever we say that they run so it refreshes in the background and we don't need to be there now this already happens in make.com and NA10 and we call ituling a workflow and that leads us very nicely onto the fourth step of our maps framework which stands for serverless AI infrastructure now if you take a platform like N10 for example or make.com we can add a module here which is called schedule trigger which says hey on Tuesday at 2 p.m i want the entire thing to refresh now to show you exactly this in practice I'm going to use something slightly different because what we could potentially do obviously with our scraper is just get it to scrape every day but it's not going to be easy for you to understand it that way so what I'm going to do is we're going to use an API here called screenshot bomb so we're going to go onto a web page we're going to take a screenshot of it and then we're going to save it and we're going to ask this system to do that for us every single minute on repeat and then when you understand how to trigger these scenarios whether you're on your laptop or not you'll be able to encrush it and expose the full power of anti-gravity and these cool systems so what we're going to do is we're going to come down we're going to open up a brand new environment so open a new folder okay we'll call this one something like screenshot bot awesome great and we just open this one up and we just get a brand new environment awesome cool and then I'm going to give it the following instructions to sort of show you how you can actually do this because when you know how to get this to run automatically for you in the background you can effectively do anything hey there dude I would like you to use the screenshot one API using the blur credentials i want you to set it so this runs every 60 seconds on modal so whether I'm using my laptop or not this will run for us autonomously in the background and then what I would like you to do is to create a table in our superbase and basically every time it runs every 60 seconds I want you to save a URL to that screenshot awesome okay so what we've got is we've got the code running it's going to be running in Mod and then we're going to save that in Superbase and the credentials we're going to use for this is going to be the screenshot API so let's come through to the dashboard real quick beautiful and then let's just say we want to grab this here and it's got a token in it as well and we just copy this right here and then we come back and simply paste in the code and since we actually have the superbase MCP I've just enabled it now so we can say hey go ahead and actually use that itself and as you can see finding superbase project ID to run the setup SQL and we don't have to go back and forth to superbase and it can create that for us automatically and so once we've done that anti-gravity comes back with the next step we say yes and once that's complete it will actually set that up for you because it's got the superbase URL so if we actually come over you can see now in Modal we have this thing running every 60 seconds in reality you wouldn't really need to but it's the fact that you can and know how to so if I click on this you can see all these different runs that it's done and at any point you can click on run now and that will trigger it instantaneously which is cool and this is really really sick guys then if you actually come over to Superbase I can see I've also created a screenshot section for me so you can see I've got five rows here right now if I just say run now this should instantaneously schedule immediate run actually add in a sixth one if I were to refresh the page and now it's add a sixth and seventh that one's gone and then we've got the URL so we lally copy this right here for example come up open up into a new tab and then we'll just to see the actual URL that it saved which is freaking cool and it just runs for you automatically in the background and you can see there's describe screenshot and now we've covered technically exactly how you build within anti-gravity the next thing we need to do is understand how do you actually leverage this incredible technology to scale your business grow your business and help your clients and you can do that by learning how to build systems like I show you in this video right Yeah
