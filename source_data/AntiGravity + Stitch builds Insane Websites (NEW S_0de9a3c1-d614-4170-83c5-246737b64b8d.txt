imagine if you could combine Google's number one design agent Stitch with Google's anti-gravity a new school dropped which means that it is now possible and it is a cheat code if you know how to use it correctly so in this video I'm going to show you exactly how to combine Stitch and anti-gravity so you can create gorgeous designs faster than anybody else and to a better quality and unlike other videos I'm actually going to show you the full capabilities and how to host it if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts i'm currently in South Africa hence the background i built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a 7 figureure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee like this one from South Africa and let's dive straight in so Google Stitch is Google's number one design agent in simple terms it is an AIdriven UI and UX design assistant that helps you make beautiful designs in minutes you can build beautiful websites stylish apps you have something called 3x mode that let you build things three times at the exact same time and it's also completely free to use some say also as well is powered by Gemini 3 flash which is at the moment the best UIUX model on planet earth you can also extract design identities from images and websites instantaneously as well as do what we call multi-page generation and this is one of the looping skills that's going to blow your mind this video and then we have Google anti-gravity the big boy so to speak and this can create amazing software and it can automate essentially anything that you can imagine which basically means that combining them together means that you can create modify and iterate at scale add infin item as they say and the thing that makes it possible is this selfbuilding loop between anti-gravity and Google stitch now you can replicate with this any style you can build everything page by page and so much more and this is all enabled by one thing that recently changed and it's this new stitch skill and I call them the six power skills cuz it's six different capabilities now with an anti-gravity that basically lets you access unlimited project analysis you can build react component systems stitch loops which is going to blow mind we can enhance any prompt in the building of these websites in Stitch and we can even create video walkthroughs for the stuff we make in Stitch so with that in mind let's unlock it now the great news is there's only four things we need to do to leverage the capabilities of Stitch and anti-gravity but if we don't understand some of the basics of Stitch there's no way we can possibly leverage all these superpowers which is why the first thing is building in Stitch so if you're pro Stitch feel free to skip this section i'll put a timestamps down below to make life easier but the first thing I want to draw attention to within Stitch is this so you can give it two components i'm also going to show you when you would go anti-gravity first in this video really important to understand so you can add either an image or a website URL so for example why don't we take our beautiful speech tech startup glider just released in beta and let's give this as an example so you come over here you pick your input sources you can give multiple and let's say that we want to look at this as a competitor URL i can click on that now any prompt that I give them will basically lean on this style so I might say something like "Hey there I would like you to build for me a three-page web app for Glider which is a speechtoext software and what I would like you to do is just make it like a three-page signup where I don't know you pick your plan and then maybe you do a little bit of customization and then maybe there's like a checkout page at the end awesome now what I'm going to do as well is control A on this and say "Hey Jack could you do me a favor could you just enhance this prompt please to make it more specific?" This is something in Glider it's called aentic mode it basically lets you highlight text and do pretty much anything that you want to cool that's really decent and then we can just send this one off and there we go and also you'll notice that we've got the Gemini 30 flash mode which is really cool oh and if you're wondering why it's called Jack you can pretty much set the name of whatever you want to within GLAD it's very very cool and just like this guys we're now rocking and rolling and by the way if you wonder what the cap is guys we're in South Africa very very beautiful met a lot of people in AI space this uh this week it's been awesome but that's got nothing to do with this wonderful website here so look at this it's designed all three things simultaneously for us right so select your plan which is cool you've got these wonderful things interestingly it's pulled this from the website so this you can use for free but it's obviously got a paid version to it enterprise custom and again this is really freaking sick so this is exactly how it works now what you can do with this in within Stitch is you can select things like this which selects it and then I might say see you got this 3x thing down here which means it gives you three alternatives i might say something like "Hey dude could you add just like a really interesting beautiful image at the top and maybe add make the button you know multicoloric so it kind of like has a nice kind of vibrant animation style to it please." And then let's also just have fivestar testimonial at the bottom that make that looks great so the idea is you can give it feedback and this really belies I think the most important feature of stitch and this idea that you can actually go through and edit it page by page which I think is by far it strongest feature because in a lot of places you kind of do one shot right you fire it off then everything comes here I can go step by step and say ooh I like that I don't like that and I can give it different feedbacks as I go through the whole thing and I can select the images that I want to the other little tip I'll give you as well it should never take longer than 2 minutes to create if it is usually something's gone wrong this is like 30 seconds so you'll be fine Now as you can see it's now generating three different versions which means I can look at A B and C and make a judgment call what I want the other thing that you need to understand with this as well is let's say that you look at this i mean look at this this is great nano Banana by the way which is the strongest image generation model is uniquely built into this anyway so anytime it generates an image it has that capability just like anti-gravity does now let's say that you look at these three you think this is really cool you can pick the one that you want to it's kind of followed we can pick our styles if we don't like it we just backspace and say "See you later Ella Gator." So we can delete these guys which we've done we've removed them you can anything you don't like the look of is very easy let's say we don't like this let's control and remove one thing you can do as well in stitch is you can click on edit and you can annotate or edit theme this is actually really cool so you see this theme stuff on the right hand side here guys i can pick the color whatever I want to go through let's say I want to go for black or whatever it is i can edit the corners i can select fontage which is cool obviously you know fonts is really important monstrat is a great one and we can apply the theme and essentially that will then update this as essential this kind of page for us so you can essentially play around with this at any point if you want to undo your deletions you can just control and Z i actually kind of think the first one was the best style which is awesome and of course you can do a customization so effectively the first thing I recommend you do within Google Stitch is get something that represents your brand identity we can use that later to build out and add additional pages so say for example we build this style here right and we think to ourselves this is cool but wouldn't it be wonderful if we wanted a fourth page well it can do that based on the existing styles that we already have now the last thing you want to understand with this is the export so I can click on export here and what I can do is come down i can do AI studio which is the online version of anti-gravity or crucially I can do a dotzip which is really cool and I just click on export like so when you click on that it downloads it to your computer and you can actually just upload that to anti-gravity so you can see I've downloaded here stitch.zip i just open that up that's stitch which is great and what I can do is come over here and open folder in anti-gravity come over to stitch just click on open and then I've got the whole thing and then what we can say to anti-gravity really simply is once it loads up is give it a command so I might say "Hey there I've imported code for a three-page web app i'd like you to codify this into an application and then open it up into a local host please." And what this then means is that anti-gravity can take this beautiful visual layer because remember Google Stitch is what we call design first creation right whereas anti-gravity is concerned about building you software that's scalable that won't break and can do various different things and by combining the assets and strength of both of them we can do many things and this is just the very ABC what I'm going to show you next is going to completely blow your mind with this stuff and so now you understand the ABCs of Google Stitch and how epic it is the next thing we need to do then is integrate it with anti-gravity so you can literally give anti-gravity all of the design power that sits within Google Stitch and one little thing to call out first of all by the way on the left hand side you might notice there's more sections than before when you export it basically one of the things that you want to make sure that you do is let me come back over and show you this if I come over to Stitch when you click on export just make sure that you select like screens like command and select the three things that you want to and then export it and it'll do that for you straight away both the image and also the HTML to turn that into something real one other little hack as well if you click on share for example you can share this with your buddies with your team uh to help build those designs and make it really cool so what's the first thing we need to do well what we need to do is connect anti-gravity to Stitch the way that we do this is v something called model context protocol or MCP you can access this and all MCP is just a universal remote control the idea being that it allows anti-gravity and stitch to talk with one another so if you come up here for example you click on these dots we click on MCP servers click on manage MCP servers and what you'll see for me now is Stitch and I'm going to remove this and uninstall it with you so you get a great idea of how to do it also in a foolproof way that means you don't have to understand any code at all what we need to do first of all is get your API key for Stitch so let me go ahead and grab that so you want to come over to stitch.withgoogle.com/s settings but I'll put all the links for you down below and I'm going to do is come down and click on create a key you're going to copy that key and just save it for me one second and then the other thing you need is what's called this MCP config which is basically just this right here and all you're going to do is come down where it says your API key in just paste this whatever the thing is and then you're going to copy this then head back over to anti-gravity and don't worry I'll put all this down below again so you can just copy it and grab it no problem now as you can see in my MCP server now I've got stitch with six really really cool skills in it now you won't see this because you haven't added it yet if something's red it just means that it can't connect so Fireflies for me shows as red for example because I rotated in other words I changed my API key so that gives you a great sort of idea of what's going on there so what we're going to do now is you're going to click on view raw config and this is basically the code version of all that stuff so it's actually seven different connections they're just all little MCP configs just like that now here's a really cool thing you want to do is you want to come back over to the agent now look this agent is working on something which is really cool which means I can show you one of the coolest features of anti-gravity that I absolutely love if you come over here to open agent manager at the top let me just make sure that you can see it okay cool open agent manager now the cool thing is it doesn't matter what workspace you're in because this is talking to anti-gravity as a whole so what you want to come down here is do app and do MCP and it's already pulled that up and all you're going to say is "Hey there dude i'd like you to add this to my MCP config please." All right cool and then you're going to come down here and you're going to paste that in like that and then click on go and then this will add it to your MCP configuration which now means that you can interact with Stitch via anti-gravity and as you can see here it said "Hey I'll help you do that i can see that it already exists there's already an existing password so it'll just go ahead and update that for me and I'll work for you straight away." And now we can come back here and it says it is actually finished and complete so let's drop and remove all these things here and then we can actually look at the full application so I'll just say "Sounds awesome open it up for me in a local host please." Loc host just means that obviously because it's not on the cloud with online or laptop it's just running on your computer which is awesome which means that we can just see it now in a browser like anything else i always like to ask it to open it up because I just find that if you're just starting off it's very easy just to click and rock and roll so this will give us a link it will open up and then we should be able to see this really cool application and you can see now within local host we have this interactive thing but here's a really cool thing if you come back over to anti-gravity I can say hey I want it to be more of an app style you can give it feedback and it can work on it simultaneously and whilst it's doing that we can actually do and build many other things so for example if I come back over now to open agent manager we can now have different conversations with different parts of anti-gravity simultaneously so for example check this out i can say something like hey dude using my stitch MCP first thing I want you to do is grab for me every project that I've used within the last 7 days please something like that right send that off and you can see how this is now going to connect to StitchMPP to bring everything down for us and then we can start looking at the magic now check this out it's using the MCP tool stitches list projects it's basically gone down and final output and look at this it's got everything we've used in the last 7 days glider plan selection it's got this is really freaking cool and now we got everything we want to we can even click on thumbnails we've got visible screens it tells you everything that you need to know and this is important because what this now means is that anti-gravity means that we can use these thing programmatically we can actually do anything we want to to as many as we particularly want to and we can see all the different changes here which is insane and not only that but if I click on something like view thumbnail for instance I can see exactly what I was creating for each of those Stitch projects and now you've learned how to connect anti-gravity and stitch the next thing I'm going to do is unlock one of its most powerful features which is its autonomous looping ability and what this basically means in layman's terms is that we can build this stitch as many websites or applications or ideas as we pretty much have maybe we like coffee beautiful South African coffee I don't know we want to do four websites simultaneously we can do that via anti-gravity spin them up and even manage them within Sturge which is code for pretty freaking crazy so let's head over to anti-gravity and I'll show you exactly how you do that all right so we come back over we can see this has made some interesting updates for us let's check it out and we got glider upgrade your voice and we got this beautiful app i mean look at this this is crazy stuff marcus Sterling verified CEO of Nexus Technologies come down i mean this is awesome this is all done by the way with freaking Stitch and anti-gravity it's crazy continue to payment we could obviously integrate Stripe i've got so many videos on the channel and obviously a lot more in the community showing you some of these specifics which is cool but the idea is now we built a app with this so then to actually create this autonomous looping function we need to get the stitch skills so you're going to head over to this GitHub repo again I'll put links down below and all you're going to do is come down to code and just click on copy then head straight back over to anti-gravity and over here we're going to say hey there dude I'd like you to install these skills into this repository for me for stitch all right and then come down and paste that repo in and then what anti-gravity will do is go over to that repository repo just being a fancy word for place we put files and but it's going to bring all this stuff and throw it into anti-gravity for us then we have those six beautiful skills so think about it like this the MCP connection just connects them together right we're now we can talk to one another we can communicate with each other what the skills do is give it capabilities so one for example is you know the ability to create these looping websites where it can just keep keep on creating and creating and creating and it does this by giving it some very very specific instructions which is really freaking cool and the skills generally speaking are really helpful because what we really do is we find out the stuff that works and then we codify it we provide code that we know works and is reliable i would say that it just makes it less variable so you know you're going to get wonderful great outputs because we worked and built these skills and the great news for you is that they're all there and actually you can probably see the left hand side now that we've got this glider customization stepper all the skills have been added which is fantastic and they've put them right there and you can even see it explains all the skills we've got and under this glider customization stepper agent skills design MD rack components blah blah blah so what we're really interested in is the stitch loop so let's give it a prompt and let's do a brand new window just to avoid contact being say you have for example now a million tokens the first half of it amazing you and I fresh and bushy eyed at 9:00 a.m the second half it's 11:00 p.m we've not eaten in weeks we're starving so we want to change it so you get good output so dude what I would like you to do is use the Stitch MCP and the Stitch Loop skill that you have access to and I'd like you to build for me two separate projects in Stitch one is going to be for the sale of let's say beautiful South African coffee and the second is going to be for Heath Herring jackets i want you to use the exact same style that's present within the glido webpage design and let's make both of them three pages it should be mobile app homepage it should be pick options and then the third one should be a checkout awesome fantastic and obviously we can do a gentic mode if you want to with GLO i could say "Hey Jack do me a favor could you just improve this prompt a little bit just make it a little bit more specific include any tools that you think might be relevant what's important is that it really focuses in on replicating that style." Cool and then glider with a gentic mode can just change this kind of make sure it's a really decent prompt and we'll crush it and we even got all the specific stuff which is awesome and what's really cool with this guys is you can see how it's adding a MCP store create project create project create a screen from text and it's going down and create the different pages for the complete different designs that we gave it and bear in mind anti-gravity can in the background where you're drinking your coffee spending time with your kids hitting the gym doing that incline bench press whatever you want to do which is what makes this so spectacular and it's using design assets that you've got but then it gets really even cooler than that because if we actually head back over to Stitch and I'm on the homepage you can see that it's building all the stuff for us there and what's even cooler than that is that we're not paying for any credits with this like it's actually being done now specifically within Stitch which means we're leveraging these models at no cost to yourself and look at this guys look at the quality of this Heath Herring Premier Heritage Jacket it's all these images by the way like how insane is Nana Banana because we could have even specified this and give it specifics i go in more depth than that on my design master classes and stuff but you can get the idea now it is absolutely gorgeous and it's captured to a tea the glido brand guideline style i come down I've got another again it's showing me different options it is literally outrageous and I'm coming over to my coffee ones this is premium South African coffee which is cool very very decent i'm kind of comparing the coffee a little bit from South Africa to Dubai to see like my kind of preference let's have a look at this this is ridiculous that is really gorgeous different options there again like VLR guys think about typography style everything that we want to want our coffee collection this is freaking gorgeous guys this is actually insane so I like the look of the coffee one right so why don't we take this coffee why don't we then embed this into an actual app that we could probably just post online and let other people use and and buy our stuff basically so what we're going to do is we're going to swing back over to anti-gravity and within anti-gravity I'm going to give it the following instruction which is "Hey there dude i love the design that you built for the coffee website what I'd love you to do is to delete all the files on the left that aren't to do with the skills and I'd like you to turn those into an app and when you've done that I want you to create a GitHub repo and push it to that repo again I want it to be a mobile app using those brand guidelines that I can click through and go through step by step as you've exactly as you've created it within Stitch sweet so we send that one off and then what we're going to do guys is give it that prompt and what we need to do is connect it to GitHub which if you're not familiar like I say is just a place where we store it wonderful so now it's actually completed and done that the next thing that we need to do then is actually just make sure my design's great and then we can publish it so I'm going to say "Hey dude sounds ace just open this for me on a local host so I can check it out." Sweet and then what I'm going to do guys is head over to GitHub very very simply if you haven't got an account completely free to do just a place where we throw files so we can connect things come on left hand side to new and let's call this one something like coffee with a th00and ease description can be coffee again it doesn't really matter we're not doing anything crazy click on create repo and increasingly what we're going to do here guys is grab this code come back over to anti-gravity and then what we're going to say is awesome publish it to this GitHub repo for me please all right and then we hit enter and what this will do is publish it and then we can make it private which means that no one else can add any amendments to it which I'll show you very briefly so to do that you just come into settings and then all you're going to do is scroll down and then you're going to see change visibility click on this and change it to private if it's private and then only you and your specific connection can do that and so now we've created this beautiful application the last thing we want to do is then connect it to what we call versel which means that the world can see your entire app and then any change that you ever make to this in anti-gravity will be immediately reflected in your app so you want to change your prices you want to add new products we can just chat now to our app and our website and it will work for us straight away so to do this we're going to head over to a website called versel.com looks new completely normal let me introduce you to the future of AI right so click on add new and all you can do is add project now this you connect to GitHub which is really cool and you'll see the project the basically the project will just appear for you there you click on import real quick and it will auto decide the application preset and you click on deploy down below but before we do that let's just double check that all the files are there so we come back over to anti-gravity you can see it's now done and it's uploaded which is great so let's come back over and then click on deploy which would be fantastic and then what this means is that we'll have an app literally within seconds vel is a reflection of GitHub so whatever exists in GitHub will be the cell and the cool thing is we update GitHub via anti-gravity which is cool so this is going to deploy other cool thing you can do is pretty much do anything you want to right in terms of So this is really cool so you see how it's got a 404 not found amazing so what you want to do is click on rightclick click on inspect and you can see this little red X what we're doing now is looking at the code of the website so if it tries to load something and is like a failure we can actually always see what that is so if I click on this thing here you can see failed to load with server 401 amazing so what you're going to do is copy this like so you're going to come back over to anti-gravity and then you're going to say "Hey there dude sounds ace this has failed to load on the cell please make sure that the code is appropriate and ready to be hosted online and fix this error please." And then uh reupload it to GitHub okay going to come down paste that which is sweet then hit send typically speaking it's always best practice to say "Hey I'm going to host this on Bell or whatever." Just make sure the code's okay but often times you're always going to run into something not working because this is code and these models what we call probabilistic not deterministic in other words if you ask the same question 100 times you're going to get a 100 different answers right cuz it's next token prediction whereas like things that are more deterministic is if it's blue go left if it's red go right so we do this we can help these AIs out with these things and this is all just to say that if it doesn't work that's completely normal and this is exactly how you troubleshoot it typically speaking what's great is that you can kind of just like screenshot it and you can see look at this the issue is that Vel is looking for an index.html file by default let me just change this okay really freaking simple you actually don't really need to know all the wiring and the plumbing you just need to know that it works so now we've done that which is awesome i'm going to accept these things and we can go back now and check on the website which would be wonderful and by the way if you like this kind of content and you'd be sad if you didn't see any I'd encourage you to hit subscribe down below it does help out the channel a lot but also means that when I post stuff especially hit the notification bell you'll get more videos like this popping up in your feed so I can help you out with this stuff if you find it very cool so we're going to accept this stuff down here down below click all the accept all and then we're going to be ready to rock and roll and just like that one change and it's done no more4 error let's go check it out it's going to come over here and if I just duplicate this page let's see what magic we see and then let's refresh it at the top and there we go premium South African coffee we got different things here we can browse a collection and now you got a beautiful app powered by Stitch and anti-gravity knowing how to connect Stitch and anti-gravity is one thing but if you don't know some of the most powerful design hacks in anti-gravity you are leaving so much value on the table and we can learn that by watching this video right
