# Heavy Transport Command Network (The Decision Engine)

> We are not building a Yelp for truckers. We are building the North American Heavy Haul Network. This is the **Logistics Command Center** where brokers decide who to hire in seconds, not browse for minutes.

## 1. Directory Anatomy (High-Trust Decisioning)

Instead of a "company list," every profile is a **Constraint Resolution Intelligence Node**.

| Component | Logic |
|---|---|
| **Identity Graph** | Living history of routes run, certifications (TWIC/WITPAC), and reputation score. |
| **Reliability Score** | Automated performance grading: On-time rate, Cancellation rate, and Safety history. |
| **Availability Signal** | "Likely Available" / "Booked" / "Limited Capacity" based on GPS/Calendar sync. |
| **Geographic Heat Map** | Visualizing their **actual** operating range, not just a business address. |

## 2. Decision Categories (Constraint Mapping)

1.  **Transport Rail**: Specialized Carriers & Owner-Operators.
2.  **Compliance Rail**: Permit Agencies & Regulatory Consultants.
3.  **Escort Rail**: Basic Lead/Chase & Scarcity Steer/High-Skill.
4.  **Authority Rail**: Police/LE Coordination contacts.
5.  **Utility Rail**: Bucket Truck / Line Lift vendors.
6.  **Engineering Rail**: Route Surveyors & Bridge Stress Analysts.

## 3. The Expansion Sequence (Corridor Dominance)

We build **Liquidity Density** in high-value clusters before expanding.

-   **Cluster 1**: The Texas Triangle (Energy/Refinery Hub)
-   **Cluster 2**: Midwest Manufacturing Belt (Aerospace/Industrial)
-   **Cluster 3**: Southeast Freight Lanes (Port-to-Inland)
-   **Cluster 4**: Alberta/Ontario Cross-Border Corridor (Infrastructure)

## 4. Monetization (Priority & Gravity)
- **Verified Vendor Badge**: Charge for enhanced vetting/trust audit.
- **Priority Corridor Placement**: Top-of-region visibility for top-tier performers.
- **Decision API**: Shippers pay to access the "Command Network" data via Enterprise API.
