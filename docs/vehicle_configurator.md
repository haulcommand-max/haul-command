# Vehicle & Gear Configurator: Closing the Operational Loop

The Configurator is a high-utility tool that matches specific "Haul Command" gear to a user's vehicle and facilitates professional installation.

### The "Fitment" Engine Logic
- **Mounting Resolution**: If no factory rack exists (e.g., Ford Maverick), suggest **Rack Install** or **Magnetic Feet** as mandatory prerequisites.
- **AMC Product Line**: Priority matching for **Wonder Pole**, **Road Guard Vest**, and specialized **CB Radios**.
- **Electrical Capacity**: Check for auxiliary battery or high-output alternator requirements for high-draw lightbars.

| Input | Logic | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Year/Make/Model** | OEM Mounting Point Audit | Rack vs. Feet recommendation. |
| **Product Category** | AMC Pilot Car Catalogue | Wonder Pole / Road Guard Vest / AMC CB. |
| **Cab/Bed Config** | Weight/Clearance limits | Specific wiring harness and footing kits. |
| **State/Prov Regs** | Cross-ref state specs | Compliance-ready Sign & Light bundle. |

## 2. The Conversion Path (The "One-Tap" Ops)

1.  **Configure**: User builds their gear kit for their Ford Maverick / F-150.
2.  **Checkout**: Gear is purchased via the Haul Command Store (Phase 13).
3.  **Schedule**: User selects a local **Vetted Install Partner** from the Command Network (Phase 15).
4.  **Completion**: Gear is shipped to the partner; installation is confirmed via the app.

## 3. National Install Rail (Strategic Moat)

A white-label network of specialized automotive and heavy-duty shops across the US and Canada.

-   **Standardized Pricing**: Flat-rate install fees negotiated by Haul Command.
-   **Vetting**: Shops must be verified for insurance and specialized wiring (lightbars/CB).
-   **Gravity**: Once an operator has their gear installed via our network, they are deep in our "Ecosystem Atmosphere."

## 4. Monetization
- **E-commerce Margin**: 15–30% on gear sales.
- **Install Referral Fee**: 10–15% commission from the partner shop.
- **Fleet Refresh Subscription**: Annual hardware/compliance audits for fleets.

**Status**: PLANNING
**Goal**: Turn "Interest" into "Installation."
