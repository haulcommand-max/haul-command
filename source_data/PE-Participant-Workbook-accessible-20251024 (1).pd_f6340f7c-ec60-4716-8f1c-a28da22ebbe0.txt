6. Lesson Plans 

The lesson plans are designed to involve the participants interactively in the learning process. The detailed, interactive lesson plans for the course sessions are presented by individual session. Attainment of each course objective will be evaluated through discussion periods at the end of each session. The ability of the participants to apply knowledge and skills learned during the lessons and specific cases will be evaluated through a group activity, and completion of a pre- and post-test.

14-26.00411 Procedure for Issuance of Permits. 

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this rule chapter is to protect the public safety, to reduce interference with traffic flow on state 

owned highways and structures, and to preserve the state’s transportation facilities by providing standards and procedures to govern issuance of permits for overweight and overdimensional vehicles and loads operating over state owned roadways and structures. Travel authorization and/or permits for travel on local roadways must be obtained from local authorities. The rules of this rule chapter apply to all persons or entities operating overweight and overdimensional vehicles and loads over state maintained roads, which are not specifically exempt under Chapter 316, F.S. 

(2) Intent. It is the intent of the Department to require that all reasonable steps be taken to reduce the vehicle load to legal limits of weight and dimensions. Permits for overweight and overdimensional vehicles and loads are intended for a single item load which cannot reasonably be dismantled or disassembled and which cannot reasonably be shipped by rail, water, or air. 

(3) Administration. The administration of these rules is assigned to the Department’s Permit Office, located in Tallahassee, Florida, whose mailing address is: Florida Department of Transportation Permit Section 605 Suwannee Street, MS #62 Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0450 

(4) Permitting Process. Payment for permits shall be in cash, by cashier’s check, personal or company check, money order, or credit card. Permit requests must be received at least ten business days before scheduled movement for non-routine permits. The applicant must complete all fields on Form 850-040-02, Request for Special Road Use Oversize/Overweight Permit Application rev. 6/16 incorporated herein at , or complete an online Application at 

, and provide the following: https://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref-07283 

www.fdotmaint.com/permit (a) Total gross weight of vehicle/vehicle combination to include permitted load if over legal weight. Otherwise, the applicant 

must state that the gross weight is legal. (b) External bridge and individual axle spacings of vehicle/vehicle combination (center of hub to center of hub) if over legal 

weight. (c) Total number of axles and total weight on each axle of vehicle/vehicle combination if over legal weight. Otherwise, the 

applicant must state that the axle weights are legal. (d) Total width of vehicle and/or load at widest point. (e) Total length of the vehicle/vehicle combination and/or load from front to rear to include front and rear overhang. If there is 

any overhang, separate measurements are to be provided in addition to the total length. (f) Total height of the vehicle and/or load from the pavement to the highest point of the vehicle and/or load. (g) Description of load to be transported. (h) Requested route of travel containing detailed information including origin, destination, physical addresses, mile markers, or 

intersections. This applies to trip permit applications only. (5) The Department is responsible for verifying the load carrying capacity of the route (bridges and similar load bearing

structures). The applicant is responsible for verifying adequate vertical (height) and horizontal (length and width) clearances exist on route. No movement shall be made under any permit until the route has been surveyed to verify that the route can accommodate the vehicle and load. A survey letter must be maintained with the load during movement and produced to law enforcement and weight inspectors upon request. The survey letter must be on the hauler’s letterhead and include a signed statement verifying that the route has been surveyed, and that clearances exceed the requested permitted dimension by a minimum of 6 inches for height greater than 15 feet and 2 feet on each side for width greater than 16 feet. The surveyed route and the route shown on the permit must match. Surveying a route prior to movement of the load does not exempt the hauler from being required to obtain a permit prior to any movement. In addition, applications for permits for vehicles and loads with a height greater than 18 feet and/or width greater than 22 feet shall be supported by a survey letter from the hauler. 

(6) Structural Evaluation. In addition to the information required for issuance of a permit, a schematic of the vehicle showing all longitudinal and transverse spacings, axle weights and dimensions must be provided at least ten business days before a proposed move when any axle exceeds 30,000 pounds, or when the vehicle’s gross weight is 300,000 pounds or more. Applicants, whose vehicles gross vehicle weight is less than 300,000 pounds, will be required to provide a schematic as well when an Engineer of the Office of Maintenance, Bridge Section, determines that a structural analysis is needed.

Escorts shall operate no more than 300 feet in front of or behind the load unless road conditions or permit stipulations dictate otherwise. Escorts equipped with a vertical height indicator must precede the load at a distance which allows the permitted vehicle to take evasive action when approaching overhead obstructions. Escort vehicles in the process of escorting a permitted vehicle or load must proceed through weigh stations and must not bypass such stations. The Permittee is responsible for providing the escort with a copy of the permit prior to the move.

49 CFR 393.106 What are the general requirements for securing articles of cargo? 

(a) Applicability. The rules in this section are applicable to the transportation of all types of articles of 

cargo, except commodities in bulk that lack structure or fixed shape (e.g., liquids, gases, grain, 

liquid concrete, sand, gravel, aggregates) and are transported in a tank, hopper, box, or similar device that forms part of the structure of a commercial motor vehicle. The rules in this section apply to the cargo types covered by the commodity‐specific rules of §393.116 through §393.136. The commodity‐specific rules take precedence over the general requirements of this section when additional requirements are given for a commodity listed in those sections. 

(b) General. Cargo must be firmly immobilized or secured on or within a vehicle by structures of 

adequate strength, dunnage or dunnage bags, shoring bars, tiedowns or a combination of these. 

(c) Cargo placement and restraint. (1) Articles of cargo that are likely to roll must be restrained by 

chocks, wedges, a cradle or other equivalent means to prevent rolling. The means of preventing rolling must not be capable of becoming unintentionally unfastened or loose while the vehicle is in transit. 

(2) Articles or cargo placed beside each other and secured by transverse tiedowns must either: (i) Be placed in direct contact with each other, or (ii) Be prevented from shifting towards each other while in transit. 

(d) Aggregate working load limit for tiedowns. The aggregate working load limit of tiedowns used to 

secure an article or group of articles against movement must be at least one‐half times the weight of the article or group of articles. The aggregate working load limit is the sum of: 

(1) One‐half the working load limit of each tiedown that goes from an anchor point on the vehicle to an anchor point on an article of cargo; 

(2) One‐half the working load limit of each tiedown that is attached to an anchor point on the vehicle, passes through, over, or around the article of cargo, and is then attached to an anchor point on the same side of the vehicle. 

(3) The working load limit for each tiedown that goes from an anchor point on the vehicle, through, over, or around the article of cargo, and then attaches to another anchor point on the other side of the vehicle.

Florida Pilot/Escort Flagging – Participant Workbook S-35 

Flagger Operations 

Note: This page is NOT a part pf the Florida Administrative Code, but it is the Florida Standard for flagging according to the Florida Design Standards and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). 

Using the Stop/Slow Paddle 

Stopping Traffic 

The flagperson should stand on the shoulder of the road looking directly at the approaching traffic. To stop traffic, the Flagger must hold the “STOP” side of the paddle in the right hand, erect, and away from his/her body. With the free arm raised and the palm of the hand exposed to the driver, bring the vehicle to a full stop. Do not wave the paddle! 

After the first vehicle has been stopped, move to a spot where you can be seen by other approaching vehicles, preferably near the centerline of the roadway, and stop all remaining cars in the same manner. Remain in this position until you can permit travel through the work area. Never stand in the path of an approaching vehicle and never turn your back on traffic. 

Releasing Traffic 

(If two Flaggers are used, wait for a predetermined signal (such as two-way radios, flags, or hand signals) from the other Flagger that traffic has cleared.) Return to your original position on the shoulder. While standing to the front and right of stopped traffic, turn the “SLOW” side of the paddle to face the vehicles and with your free hand signal the drivers to proceed in the next lane. Never wave the paddle! 

Slowing Traffic 

While standing to the front and right of traffic and the “SLOW” side of the paddle to face the vehicles, with your free arm slowly wave the arm up and down indicating to the approaching traffic to slow down.

Florida Pilot/Escort Flagging – Participant Workbook S-36 

Using the Hand-held Flag 

Flag use is limited to Immediate Emergencies, Intersections, and when working on centerline or shared left turn lanes where two (2) flagmen are required and there is opposing traffic in the adjacent traffic lanes. 

Stopping Traffic 

Face traffic and extend the flag horizontally across the traffic lane in a stationary position. Extend your other hand towards traffic with palm out. Do not have idle conversation with the stopped motorist. 

Releasing Traffic 

Stand parallel to traffic, lower flag and motion traffic with free hand. Make sure to keep the flag next to your leg, so not to give mixed signals. 

Slowing Traffic 

The Flagperson shall extend the flag horizontally (like giving a stop signal), then slowly lower and raise the flag in a sweeping motion (without raising the arm above a horizontal position) until traffic slows down.
