ID: 8c12c735-a8c0-40f4-89e2-93a3b548d5b1

anti-gravity has changed everything about building beautiful websites but if you don't use the right systems you can spend weeks building websites that look bad and don't convert And after selling websites to clients for thousands of dollars I've discovered a new website operating system that is faster and easier to build creates gorgeous websites quickly and even has a backend that lets customers create accounts so that you can turn viewers into buyers faster than anyone else And if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts I built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a 7igure AI automation business So if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in And so this is the kind of website that we're going to build today Something that is gorgeous animated is going to be beautifully responsive As you go down you're going to see it's essentially as you scroll through it is just gorgeous It's animated Lots of incredible things happening You're going to learn how to build literally all this kind of stuff You can see the kind of interactivity with these kind of beautiful designs and animations We're going to show you exactly how you build all of this kind of stuff with an actual back end where users can create accounts So they can go test.com and we'll create this whole account right now Boom Beautiful names And we can even add an email address Call it google.com which is beautiful They can sign up They can access dashboards They can pretty much create anything they want to and save that information And as you can see everything is super responsive So with anti-gravity and the systems in this video we are going to build websites that look gorgeous that are full stack which means it has a beautiful back end and a front end You're going to be able to create loginins It's going to be SEO optimized and we're going to be able to do that easier than ever before with no code I might add So this is all possible for two reasons Now anti-gravity skills and Google AI Studio Now I've tested this I've tested so many different methods I spent a while going through this I can give you the best stuff that actually works when brand new stuff gets released But let's just start with skills to explain exactly what I'm talking about here As we know skills are basically like instructions that we can include within our integrated development environments or ids like anti-gravity They can include code but the TL of it is they basically power up anti-gravity right They're kind of like if you imagine near the Matrix when he says "Do you want to learn kung fu?" And they plug it in the back of his head and then he knows kung fu That's kind of how anti-gravity skills work And all you ever do with it is you literally just copy and paste or you just say "Hey download this and it will add it to your anti-gravity skills rebound which is really cool." Now the skill that we're going to talk about in this video is a new skill which is the UI and UX pro skill This is to show you how quickly this is blowing up right now This is code for blowing up very quickly by the way which is really awesome with over 20,000 five stars review at the time of recording And just to give you a sense of what it did I ran this I basically built a website and I ran it through the skill And this is just some of the stuff that it did for me once it ran through all the changes all this and this and also this and I didn't have to do anything It did over 50 individual changes uh to improve accessibility UX SEO and performance improvements It has 100 design plus rules 57 UI styles so your design looks amazing It does SEO optimizations so you can get more traffic and conversion intelligence so you can get more customers and also UX and UI frameworks so more people can use it I'm not affiliated with these in any way at all And before I even wanted to do a video on this I wanted to test specifically does it actually make a difference and will it build a better website And if it didn't we wouldn't touch it All right Jack So what is happening What what what does all this mean to us Well this is where Google AI Studio comes in which if you're not familiar is basically Google's online version of anti-gravity And there's a reason for this and it comes down to the design philosophy differences between anti-gravity and Google Studio And I'm going to show you how you can leverage both of them to make way better gorgeous applications So the design philosophy behind AI Studio is to make something that looks really impressive Their approach is to basically throw the kitchen sink at it And again we can improve this in a second And the result really needs to be visually striking and wow factor But drawback to this is the fact that it's not necessarily constituted in a way that's very scalable for a website Like it might break if you try to add things So it's not very like well structured but it's visually gorgeous By contrast let's talk about anti-gravity and how this thinks about designing websites Its design philosophy is to make something professional and maintainable it is to make incremental improvements best practice accessibility and then polish and functional but less flashy And so in this video we're going to cover all these best practices for creating actually gorgeous websites that aren't coded with just one sentence And then we're going to combine that with two core concepts which comes down to basically the sequencing and the anti-gravity skills all to build a beautiful design operating system So what this means in this video we're going to build a beautiful website with the design operating system skill And we're going to create a login so users can have an account And we're also going to deploy it so you can edit make any changes that you like Now to create this beautiful gorgeous website that enables users to sign in and is interactive and is SEO optimized we have to do only three things Now the first step is to create a beautiful front-end website using AI studio So this is the AI studio interface We're going to use this to whip up an initial first shot that we think looks kind of cool We just want this to be more like 80% correct and then we can refine it within anti-gravity Now what I recommend that you do if I just shoot over to my school community and grab this mega prompt here This design framework and I'll put a link for it down below so that you can use it straight away Basically what this design prompt does is it draws on all the expertise from the GitHub in terms of all the individual UI and UX components just to make it simple So for example the way this looks like it kind of breaks down the design into five components and when we integrate that with anti-gravity it will break your website down into minute chunks and just hyper optimize it But at the design creation stage we can actually come down here and use this to help us to think about how we want to design our website So for example you've got panel layout the style and aesthetic the color and the theme typography and then any animations and interactions So for example if I come down to pattern layout you can think about the kind of website that you want to build So for instance ooh like do I want to build a SAS Well okay cool Well typically the pattern is hero section features social proof and CTA And I would completely agree with that is the typical SAS thing having run a couple of SASes and I know that's the fact Then you've got things like e-commerce fintech crypto So we can kind of come down through this document and use it to grab things like you know the style and aesthetic like is it a specific one that you want or you don't have to think of the key words like look at this soft shadow sort of gradients rounded corners monochromatic tactile technical box shadow insert and asset So you don't ever want to make the prompt too long for AI studio You want to kind of give it a little bit of free but we want to be really specific So you can just come down here and copy and paste the different elements that you like And while that's happening let me just give you a little hack as well with Google's AI studio is that you can actually recreate websites because websites if you think of them are basically just code So this I think is a really cool website but if you come down and check it out they've got this really gorgeous they've even got all this stuff going on which is awesome They've got this really gorgeous animation down here on the pricing which is at the bottom You can see does all this really cool stuff So if you wanted to recreate that you can actually copy the website URL You basically head over to Google and then you just type in HTML website extractor like so and then you're looking for view page source When you click on this one give this a second to load up and you will see some of the wonders what it can do You literally click on this You type that in like so and click on view source code like that And then what we can do is download the website basically onto our computer So you click on download like so Download comp And then what you can do within any of these websites is you can actually add this file just like that And if you give it a prompt and just say "Hey rebuild the website with this HTML." It will actually understand some of the HTML assets And so for example this is one I did earlier Like as you hover over it it's got that gorgeous beautiful animation You can see the spacing It's just such a good and beautiful design inspired by the other website So you can use that to level up certain parts of your HTML I never ever recommend that you just like copy a website What you want to do is take inspiration and be inspired by And if a specific HTML component you think are cool you can use this to help like grab and kind of like develop those aspects of your own website A cool thing you can do as well within Canva and it doesn't have to be Canva it can be anything is to create kind of like a bit of a mood board So you can head over to different websites grab it and then what I recommend you do is just number them Come on left hand side type in say for example the number three like that Grab a three or just type three I mean this is a pretty wacky three to be fair but it helps you explain it So you could say "Hey I want the hero section to look like this." Like hero like this And then you may say something like XY you know testimonials like this right you know whatever the thing is right so you can actually help basically AI studio understand that then all you do I mean if you're from your Mac it's just command shift 5 get a screenshot and then you can literally just copy that and throw that into AI studio to get a really good prompt and then you might wonder where do I get inspiration from well let me just grab and show if I'm in the community just show you a few examples of this let me come over and grab all these different websites where basically you know you can just open up and find website inspiration of thinking dude I love the look and style style and feel the feel of that And you kind of go through and you can check out these different websites these different designs Dribble's a really cool one for websites and dashboards generally to give you some cool inspiration where you just kind of type in the thing that you like and you can come down and yeah find websites that you think do not do that kind of really reflect kind of brand identity that I like Like you may think hey this looks really freaking cool So this is a gorgeous website So you may say hey I want my hero to look like this And then you simply come down and you might screenshot that and use it as inspiration whilst keeping your own brand identity So for example then you come back over to AI Studio and you paste that in and say uh hero section like above And then if you're not sure on like how you want your brand guidelines to look but you know a certain brand has something that you want inspired by If you head over to firecrawl.dev one of the things that you can do in fcral.dev on playground for example is actually enter in a specific brand So I could type in for example glido which is the thing that I speak with on my videos Beautiful beachtote startup So I come in I type in glido.com and then format Come down type in branding and then click on start scraping and then I show you our website for instance glider.com which by the way completely built using the system The exact same thing type for free five times faster You see got nice little hover animation It's got a very specific style So for example I come back over here Now what this will do when you come down and click on branding it will show you not only our logo our favicon the original image it will show you our entire color palette and the fonts that we use And then you can use this to prompt and guide AI studio to give you designs that look really cool and obviously like all this sort of stuff which is really freaking decent And I really like this kind of vibe here This kind of style I think it's like really freaking cool So if I come down to this building website thing one of the things I would really like is this for like a SAS So say we want to do a little bit of a SAS for example and let users log in whatever use case is We just copy this and then come back over to AR Studio And then we can literally come down here and throw that in And then we want to give it a little bit of inspiration So hey I'm building a website design agency that helps viewers basically helps our clients turn viewers into buyers And the way we do that is building gorgeous beautiful websites that actually convert And then we can just drop in this pattern here which is really decent And you just kind of come through the document add bits in you want add your mood body and just kind of free flow style with it And if the first version isn't perfect completely cool Just open up a new chat window and spin it up And this is completely free to use So you're not even spending any credits to do this And so as you can see from this website I have learned on you might have guessed it glido brand guidelines So you can see how you can pull in different aspects elements So we build gorgeous websites elevating digital presence through scientific design build sites We engineer conversion engines and we got this beautiful starlight animation Secure your order Really really cool Scroll down These are some of the brands that we work with Got a nice transition engine for performance So six different things that we do Very cool Ready to convert Secure slot I like it Free AI conversion critique Okay We could play around with that but you get the idea And this can analyze a website So it's got a really cool inbuilt feature Plans at scale and let's see Ridiculously cheap totally free serious business Do you know I I really think it's it's pretty cool right And then you come down what our partners say and I can just see as many as few as I want to And then we got the thing at the bottom Really freaking cool All built with AI Studio using the techniques I just showed you So then what do we do after this Well what we're going to want to do then is actually post this onto GitHub So how do we do that Well first thing we do is exit out of here And then what you want to do is click on this save to GitHub thing by clicking on this I'm going to give it a repo name We'll call this one something like I don't know let's call it gorgeous websites right And we can just do the same thing for description We'll make this public for the time being Come down and create git repo If you're not familiar with what git repo is it's basically just a online site where we put code It's just it's like it's like a Dropbox You just store your files into it It just keeps all that different things And it's cool because if you create a git repo for a website and you want to share that with somebody else like we have some of those resources in our community like all my personal systems that help me scale my businesses You can actually go into those GitHub repos and download it Meaning you don't need to create it yourself So it's really freaking cool So we've got all these cool things We stage and commit changes It just means we push them live And the cool thing now is that this is now in our GitHub repo So we could share this with others if we wanted to But most importantly what it's going to enable us to do now is let our anti-gravity download and grab that which is really freaking cool So how do we know it works Well you just click on this It opens up And would you believe it Here are all the exact same files How freaking cool is that Now the only thing we're going to do is click on this code And you come down and you're just going to copy this Awesome Then the next thing we're going to do is go ahead and download anti-gravity.goole if you haven't already download it down to your computer which is cool So basically all we're going to do ask it is to clone the repo As you can see you just paste it in And then essentially it will come down It will grab all the information and look at this This repository has been successfully cloned It looks like a React TypeScript project Here are the files blah blah blah Here are directories Awesome So as you can see everything now is in rocking and rolling and downloaded with an anti-gravity And so now we have the project in anti-gravity and we've got our first shot of what our website looks like This is the point where we take it from zero to hero We're going to go through the entire thing and basically get like an AI operating designer brain Now this involves us heading over to this GitHub repository As you can see it's got everything in here UIUX Pro Max And this kind of explains everything that it does in a website all the specifics Now this isn't really necessarily just about the design The biggest asset of this actually is also about user experience accessibility making sure it's got all the different relevant features that make it epic And you can see the level of effort and specificity 66 67 UI styles Loads of really cool things here Look at the general styles it's got Look at the landing page styles Look at everything it's got It's really freaking cool So how do we actually go ahead and grab this Well couple ways you can do it One is just copy everything which is a really easy way to do that if you want to But effectively what I recommend that you do is simply arr say "Hey dude this is a repository with UI UX What I'd love you to do is add in this repo to this project as a anti-gravity skill Awesome Now you don't necessarily need to pay for this sort of stuff but it is really easy to do this kind of thing And then what anti-gravity is going to do now is grab it So bear in mind we have these different design philosophies with these online builders They make it look epic Now what we're going to get anti-gravity to do here is to actually make it functional and scalable So you can build multiple websites It's very scalable It can be mobile optimized It can tick all of the boxes so you can get more clients or help your clients with the designs itself which is awesome And I think one of my favorite things about this plugin which is really cool is the fact that it'll actually go through from an SEO point of view and make loads of changes to it which is really freaking cool And just like that guys look at this So for example it's now added it If I bring this up so you can see we've got the gorgeous website which is our website But then if you come to this Gemini skills UI Pro Max you can see all these workflows It's got the markdown file that explains everything It's got this Claude skills It's got Astro.csv Flutter HTML Tailwind Jetack Next.jv JV all these different things are all now fully available to you from this one skill And all you said is just install it now So the first thing that we want to do now is just basically optimize the website in accordance with the design and sort of accessibility guidelines within this skill So for example awesome dude The first thing I want you to do is in accordance with this skill is to improve and audit the website to make it better So it basically aligns with all the design principles outlined in the agents UI skills Fantastic And then send that one off and let it just go through the entire checklist And then what we're going to have it do afterwards Awesome I'd like a just a general checklist of all the improvements that you've made once you've completed also Great Just so I can know exactly what it's done when it's completed I'm beautiful guys Just like that It has now gone through and analyzed absolutely everything So check this out on the right hand side Analyzed everything And here's what it's done UI and UX improvements visual enhancements added a scale animation implemented glass forism on the background drop hero optimization increase glow intensity from 30 to 60% It's just like the thousand very small micro things that a designer or you know an accessibility specialist would do on your website navigation bar improvements pricing cards polish audit tool refinement global styling upgrades It has enhanced front rendering initializing and this is the power of anti-gravity skills And you can stack an infinite number of these skills to use within your software That's how freaking cool this is Bug fixes fixed tail and syntax error and then all these design principles it's applied and the impact Amazing So it's now running on local host 3000 So let's click on it and check it out We build gorgeous websites elevating digital presence We got the thing in the background We've got the secure your order which is cool We've got this hover over which is amazing ready to convert QS spot We can have that remove that whatever we want We've got our different layouts here which is decent Free AI conversion critique which is fantastic And then we can add that in get that website do some really cool stuff and we could build that in as an AI system Super easy And then we've got this Look at this guys This is gorgeous This is really freaking cool We may just want to have one as a border to kind of bring you into ridiculously cheap but I think it's really freaking cool And then we've got what our partners say at the bottom with all those mini micro improvements which is cool So now we've done that the next thing we want to do really is just kind of pick something that we want to improve before we let our users have let's say a login and they can like have let's say for example here where they give this website we wanted them to create an account and within that account we give them a list of breakdowns and to-dos of things they could do on their website That would be really cool But before that what if we were to just kind of like actually improve the website itself a little bit So let's think about this button here secure your audit What if we wanted to improve that Well one of the things that we may want to do is head over to let's say we go over to 21st.dev dev and I want to find this and I call this section UI sniping An idea of it is that you can basically find UI components We can also head over to a place called code pen which is cool Code pen is just gives you the code directly You can just like grab that code and pull it off where you can search for components and buttons or whatever you want to like check out this liquid gradient This is gorgeous Okay that's a little bit kind of maybe like I don't know fantasmagoric trippy type of vibe But effectively within copen for instance you can type in things like button or whatever you want and it'll give you resources for it Some things it's better than others Like button is a little bit maybe not as good But you kind of get the idea You can kind of find these beautiful things Or you just go to trending if you just want general inspiration Again not I'm not affiliated with these in any way I just think it's really freaking cool that they have these gorgeous designs Like look at this How cool is that And then all you do if you want this by the way is like okay this is freaking so cool Like check this out Look how freaking cool this is And just kind of deletes it Like that's a really nice scrolling animation So we could try and play around with that if you want to For example if I want that I might just come over copy this head back over to anti-gravity and then anti-gravity What I'm going to do is open up a new window And I'm doing that just so I get like I don't get context rot So these have a context window 200,000 tokens whatever it is But if you speak too long the performance goes down the longer you speak to it So when you do a task open a new window Hey dude I want you to add this into the website please down below underneath the testimonials please All right And then we just give it the code Actually come over and grab the code So here right copy this and come back So I we wouldn't include this on our website but I kind of just want to show you an example of how it works so you can get the idea of the power of how freaking powerful this actually is and how cool this works and the kind of things that you can do in these softwares And we just send that one off Cool So whilst this is now working on our project let's actually head over to something that we would use So for example if I come over here to buttons for example on the left hand side I can search for anything I want to Right We've got this button Do we like this button It's a very simple button Maybe I want something with a bit of a gradient on it You can just pick anything that you want to just literally scroll through find something that you like I like that one with a bit of a gradient So I wonder if I come down I type in gradient Let's see if we can find something cool So this nice gradient You can essentially just snipe and find the different buttons that you want Like this for example here I think is gorgeous Look at this Right I think this is beautiful Say I wanted this on the website What would I do Well I would come over and copy the prompt which is really cool We're okay for the moment Thank you very much 21st Dev And then we come back over to anti-gravity and say "Hey dude I'd like you to add this functionality for me please onto the web page." And then you literally just paste in the prompt and it gives you all the information that you need and it is freaking beautiful and gorgeous And then I just literally hit enter and it goes off there for us instantaneously And that will now run after the previous prompt is complete Beautiful guys So now it's completed Let me give you a little tip as well If you ever find that it doesn't do on its first try on 21st offdev a little little hack for you by the way is literally click on share component come back over to anti-gravity and say "Hey dude I want you to head over to this website and make sure you can import this and copy it line by line or give it a prompt along those lines and then you literally paste it and then it will head over and extract the component." Exactly Well let's check that it's actually done that right So let's head over to the website now Now check this out guys This is going to blow your mind You ready We're going to refresh this local host Here we go Beautiful If I scroll all the way down to the bottom do I see this Does this look familiar Look at this How freaking sick is this And obviously these can be anything And we can put this anywhere we want to Like this is literally amazing Like this is ridiculous Then if I scroll up does this look familiar Look how epic This is actually ridiculous And if you scroll left or right it just basically crushes all of it It's actually insane So what I'm going to do now is basically tell it to remove this ready to convert thing and put these put this component somewhere that makes sense So let's go back over I'm going to say "Hey dude could you remove the book a book a call pop-up in the bottom right from the page Could you put that beautiful button animation somewhere on the website that makes sense and looks epic And then maybe add some text above the card animation that we've got that says something like no need to burn your credit card money or something like that So the animation makes sense and it's all connected together beautifully." Perfect And we'll anti-gravity work on that in the background And so now you basically have a website that is gorgeous and takes the world's best UI components and it's been completely assessed by this incredible intelligent fist design system The next thing that we want to do then is create what we call a backend somewhere where customers can actually create accounts They can add information All of that information gets stored And to do that we're going to leverage a database But I can tell you this it's really interesting with connecting something called an MCP which stands for model context protocol which is basically just a way it's like a universal remote control basically that lets anti-gravity talk to anything You actually don't need to know loads of information about it and it means that anti-gravity can create all these databases for us We give it the credentials and then it's effectively ready to rock and roll So the way that we effectively accomplish this and I can see anti-gravity is making some cool changes in the background is you click on additional options and click on MCP servers and the one that you're going to look for very simply it's just something called superbase really cool you click on that mine is installed now if you haven't installed it all you're going to do is going to come down to configure and you see superbase action access token you click on this button now superbase you can make an account completely for free which is cool I think you have two environments then all you're going to do is come down to generate new token I'm going to call this one website expires in however many days that you want to I'll put mine for an hour for argument sake Click on generate token and then what it will do is generate this token Then I want you to copy that Okay And then what we can do is just obviously delete the ones that you don't need You won't delete this because you don't need it but you get the idea Now once you've done that you're going to head back over to anti-gravity and you're going to paste in your Superbase access token right there and click on save Okay Now this is saving to your config which is just the configuration And when you come to MTB config you'll see Superbase there on the left hand side which is fully enabled which is amazing And that basically means you can use it Now Superbase is just basically think about Microsoft Excel but on steroids There's a many incredible things you can do with it But crucially since you've now connected it you can speak to anti-gravity in plain English and tell it what you want it to do And this will manage everything from storing images and text and login You literally name it But there's one setting I do want you to have a look at in Superbase This is one thing that's really worth you learning because understanding databases is an incredible skill It's going to make you amazing But let me break it down the the kind of 2080 of it Right on the left hand side if you come over to authentication and I recommend that you do this just as you're building the app just to make it easier Let's say you want to have like an email sign up You can click on sign in providers here which is cool And you can let them all sign up by email by phone by Apple by Gmail There's a million different things that you can do It's so cool What you can do here is confirm email which means that we're not going to allow you to sign up for service unless you head into email and you sign That's a little bit cumbersome when you're testing it So typically speaking what I do when I'm testing the project is I'll just turn that off That's what I'll generally do And you can always see your databases and what exists by on the left hand side coming to databases right And we'll see on in a second You can see this is everything I've got there already So one for YouTube videos trends metrics whatever it is And you know you but you can speak to anti-gravity in plain English and anti-gravity will make these changes which is really cool And so let's actually go ahead now and give the command to anti-gravity Hey dude what I'd like to do is add for me a login section with an email a name and a website And then what I'd like to do when that happens is create me an account where they can basically log in with that information It saves it on Superbase And then in that I'd like them to have the ability to enter some information about their website So do me a dashboard in the same style Let's say for example they could be their goal their income and how many clients they have And I'd like all this to be saved So if I were to refresh it all the information would be there and I'd like to connect it to Superbase and let me know when that's complete please I will make the form look gorgeous Awesome So we send that off Now check this out It's going to leverage the Superbase MCP if it doesn't know already It should exactly have to do that but you're going to see that do that in a second And actually we wouldn't need to do any other configuration to get this set up than that And I'll just say here Superbase MCP just so it knows exactly what it's talking about And as you can see guys right there it's now using the Superbase MCP tool to do that just like we thought And as you can see guys anti-gravity is now complete So check this out This is gorgeous We've got this animate thing in the background We have this beautiful basically like island that follows us down We can hover over this and see all these different options and access whatever we want to Trusted by industry leaders who all the companies that we're working with scientific precision Look at this animation You hover over things This is gorgeous This is that beautiful bento style that we've got Free AI conversion critiques This is our free lead magnet Analyze that Now it's got that beautiful glow Invest in ROI So we can pick our different growth packages as we like Scroll down and then we've got all these great testimonials And can you see how well it's adhered to the brand guidelines And actually if I just come back up and show you this this itself by the way can do so many different things We can capture emails with this But if I come back down you can see start burning cash on bad websites Look at this guys Like this is amazing This is like actually crazy And then towards the bottom of it we've got a beautiful signup journey where we can actually capture emails and they can create accounts And then we've got all of our links at the bottom with this beautiful phenomenal design So let's test this one out shall we So I'll call this one alexal.com We'll give it a password My name will be Alexson Maybe I should say Patty cuz Patty's fighting this weekend I know we've got a weekend a kind of like a website ufc.com for all our beautiful MMA fans out there Then we click on access dashboard and look at that responsiveness This is so gorgeous I click on access dashboard Remember it's alexal.com Let's copy that so we can test it Yes let's save the password And guys look at this This is By the way I just said build me a dashboard and it's done it So we can I mean this is sample information to show you what I mean But you could upload photos here You could do anything you want to Hey dude my goal is to compete and take home the UFC lightweight title this weekend Okay awesome Monthly income Let's put that at $150,000 Roies and active clients can be two million clients whatever And we can save those changes Changes saved successfully Cool So we've got our goals got everything we need to website all this data Now here's really cool If I log out for example Okay Yeah that's fine And then let's just say for example that I refresh the page again Now what if I want to log in Well I click on login It takes me down here past all of our beautiful cards I actually think this is so freaking cool Stop burning cash and bad websites It's like your credit card getting crushed and stuff It's cool I'm going to put all the link for this website in the community It's so freaking sick But look we got alexal alex.com We can come down here I click on login and let's see if it's got my information And would you look at this guys Monthly income goal active clients How freaking sick is this And we can also validate this in Superbase So if I head over now to Superbase this is in Chrome Let me come over to a different web page which is going to be this one right here So we've got users which is cool What we can do on the left hand side is click on tables which is sweet and test this all out So if I come down to I think it's going to be users down here So we click on this button here and we click on view in table editor and we should see Alex right So just to show you how this is all connected I've got alexal.com Look at this guys Alex alex alexen website.com So if I change this to bellour.com right will that be reflected Well let's test it out and find out shall we So if I come back over to conversions and I refresh this I'll just uh come back into the dashboard real quick and we see beltor.com How freaking cool is And again if I go monthly income is now $1 I save changes I come back over to here and then I refresh this I don't think we store the actual dollar amount here but like yeah you'll see that this is now going to be reflected So if I come back over to it should be on user dashboard for example we will see the $1 mark appear There you go Income is $1 So obviously we'll need to add role level security to this Make sure it's protected and clicking both And the way that you do that obviously is you click on it for example and you click on RLS disabled Just enable RLS for this site That enables role level security within the superbase All right cool So that's all enabling very very very cool We got for our tables and we are ready to rock and roll And so now we've created this beautiful gorgeous responsive website that users can create accounts with They're kicking butt The next thing that we need to do now is actually host it online so that people can actually log in buy our services and see it whenever they want to And so the first step of that is actually pushing it back to GitHub So we're going to come over here and say "Hey there dude I want to push this live now to GitHub Could you make sure that the files are in order and that everything is appropriate so I can actually push this onto GitHub I then plan to host this on Versel So please do any necessary amendments and push this back to GitHub please Beautiful We send that one off Fantastic And then what we're going to do after that is then host this onto Versel which will take all the code that we got on GitHub and let it be a beautiful website And from Versel we can do anything We can do things about we can track metrics we can track views page speed pretty much anything we want to Then going forward anytime I ever want to make a change to this website I just do it here at anti-gravity that updates GitHub and then GitHub will because Vel is and I'll show you what VEL is in a second It's just a reflection of GitHub That's all it is It's just reflecting the code and it just gives you extra access to do various things which you'll see in a second So let's head over to Vel now and check that one out So good The build works there but let me duplicate the keys in here Let me fix this quickly So it's doing everything all the relevant checks to make sure it's all ready to rock and roll and we'll work with Vel So what on earth is Vel Well let's head over and find out exactly and so I can show you specifically So we head over to versel.com I want you to create an account And all you're going to do is connect your GitHub Okay And then what you do is you click on add new and you're going to come down to let me just move this out the way Add project And what you're going to see is the thing that you created which is Gorgeous Websites which is really decent And then you click on import That was a few hours ago cuz I just went to the cinema to watch 28 Years Later Part Two Amazing film Highly highly highly recommended by the way So this is very cool but I want to make sure that GitHub is updated before I deploy it onto the cell Okay beautiful It is now fully committed to GitHub which is fantastic So what do we do Well you might have guessed it We head over to Vel As you can see their hobby plan their free plan is very very generous So let's come over We've got it I'm just going to refresh this page and then we are going to hit on the deploy which is awesome So come down here hit deploy and we are ready to rock and roll You might notice environmental variables That is the kind of thing that you would use if you are connecting this to chat GPT or maybe you have various different things you need to do Now we're most likely going to need to connect basically our superb basease to this So we are going to need to add environmental variables So this isn't going to load in the first instance But what's really cool is you can actually connect a Versel MCP to you might have guessed it anti-gravity which means we don't actually need to mess around with it But this seems to have loaded perfectly So let's open this up and check it out All right I'm rocking and rolling And look at this guys Gorgeous website at bell.com This is amazing I'm just even turn the brightness up now That's how powerful this is View our work Look at this This is freaking gorgeous Come down And again we've got everything now And so it's now hosted on its own website which is beautiful Going to come down again We've got this beautiful animation Let's now create an account together So let's go down and create one Let's go for a different email address which is cool We'll add a bit of a different password Name will be John Doe And then a website can be let's just go with YouTube.com All right Sweet Come down Access dashboard Fantastic Give that a hot second Great We'll save that And now we are in John Doe which is awesome cuz our main goal income active clients bada bing come down here save changes Beautiful Again obviously this is just like a sample example but you can kind of get the idea now that basically come back to dashboard and everything is still loaded there for us with all our revenue our active clients and our main goal Okay beautiful So that's all locked and loaded but I want to secure this and the way we're going to secure this now is we're going to make sure that the environmental variables for superbase are actually added through into this But it's amazing that it's live This is how we're now going to go ahead and secure them So click on continue to dashboard Now this dashboard here is where you can check everything You can check your deployments and just see how effortless it just literally uploaded first time You are going to get it to do that a lot more if you basically just say to it hey I'm going to publish this on Versell Just make sure that everything's in order for me to be able to do that So you can see everything that you need within here You've got things on analytics which is really cool One of the things I like to add is basically this thing here for page views which is really cool So you can enable web analytics You click on enable which is fine We can do this in the hobby view but basically you just cannot exceed 50,000 views per month We click on enable and basically what this what is doing is it gives you some package And so all we do to get analytical view and obvious dashboard is you literally copy this You come into anti-gravity you throw it in and then all you do is copy this come back over to anti-gravity do the exact same thing that will save it and push it to GitHub And then underneath here you'll get your full web analytics and you can see your page views your bounce rate all that key data But the first thing I want to do is make sure that we lock in superbase with the environmental variables Remember anything like that we put in the environmental variables And guys I actually have the VEL MCP within my store And look at this It's called the Velist So I don't even need to touch the environmental variables Anti-gravity has done that for me Or should I say Claude Sonic 4.5 with anti-gravity And so I don't need to do anything So if you click on this button here click on MCP servers I click on manage MCP servers you can see there's the beautiful VEL Now the ones that I have activated and I'll show you how you activate it first What I've done for you in this document here at the bottom I put a VLE MCP guide So the link to get your API key basically just replace this here which is insert Vell API key with the token that you create And then I just want you to copy and paste this this text right here Come over to anti-gravity paste it in and it will work for you Now it's got 150 connections The 10 I use are 1 six 12 13 14 15 And then I use these ones down here Also as you can see the number the last one the last four I use are right there which is really cool And then it'll be able to be changes for you And you can validate that by coming over here heading back over to Versel And basically guys let me just run you through how you actually use those code So on here you have all your projects You click on the one that you like which is gorgeous websites All you're going to do is if I click on for example let's say I want to get speed insights or maybe want to get analytics Let's add this in So install the package Copy this Come back over Let's go back to the agent I'm going to put this in here which is cool And then we come back over here And then let's copy this as well And then throw that in also Beautiful Now that will then deploy And after 30 seconds we'll start getting visibility So you come on to settings Again it's just like kind of WordPress And then on the left hand side what I want you to do if you come down here to environmental variables we should see superbase And just like that you can see I've got superbase And it actually shows the keys right there And then when I come back over you can see it's now adding in the speed component so we can start to get website insights And that's basically exactly how easy it is And as you can see here guys we've got Versell analytics It's been successfully added So that's all completely now embedded in there And we can track these whenever we want to within Versel And then when I come over to Versel and I click on analytics and I refresh the page you should see now well we shouldn't have any page views right Because we've not gone live yet but you get the idea We'd actually be able to track it all here just like you would do in WordPress So now you've covered how to build these incredible gorgeous websites But if you don't know how to leverage Open Gravity with one of the most powerful tools on the planet you're never going to get the full amount of your productivity or your effectiveness And you can learn exactly how to do that by watching this video right
