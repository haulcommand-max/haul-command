# Haul Command Master Infrastructure OS — Dependency Map

This document serves as the "source of truth" for the Haul Command OS, mapping every friction point and strategic control point in the heavy-haul ecosystem.

## I. ENTRY BARRIERS (The Onboarding Rail)
- **Friction**: Training, Certifications, CDL Schools, DOT/MC/UCR/EIN registration, Business Formation, Insurance broker search.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Build the industry's onboarding gateway — education + compliance + financing bundled.

- **Strategic Control Point**: White-label gear marketplace + financing + subscription replacement model.

## III. VEHICLE MANAGEMENT (The Fleet Layer)
- **Friction**: Insurance (Auto/GL/Cargo), fleet tracking, maintenance, tire/oil/repairs, roadside/tow, breakdown dispatch.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Fleet OS + insurance rail + AI accident vault + roadside network.

## IV. PERMITS & ROUTING (The Intelligence Moat)
- **Friction**: State/Local/County/Port permits, Superloads, bridge analysis, route surveys, wind/holiday/curfew restrictions.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Permit automation engine + route intelligence + subscription compliance layer.

## V. JOB ACQUISITION (The Demand Engine)
- **Friction**: Lead boards, FB groups, brokers, cold calling, load boards.
- **Strategic Control Point**: KILL LEAD BOARDS. Build centralized dispatch rail + reputation score + verified network.

## VI. DISPATCH & OPERATIONS (The Orchestration Engine)
- **Friction**: Load assignment, ETA tracking, matching, contracts, escrow, GPS, route changes, escort/police/flagman coordination.

- **Strategic Control Point**: OWN THE PAYMENT RAIL (Rapid rail + internal factoring + compound swipe system).

## VIII. DATA & ANALYTICS (The Data Monopoly)
- **Friction**: Route efficiency, permit turnaround, wind delays, escort performance, accident probability, region heatmaps.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Monetize data exhaust (Risk intelligence, benchmarking, predictive pricing).

## IX. PORT & UTILITY WORK (Vertical Integration)
- **Friction**: TWIC, port gates, terminal/crane escort, bucket truck/powerline, transformer/wind blade/solar coordination.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Utility & port vertical integration rail (Become the safe default).

## X. PARTNERSHIPS (The Ecosystem)
- **Friction**: Hotels, truck stops, parking, fuel, insurance, training, equipment vendors.
- **Strategic Control Point**: Affiliate + partner revenue + discount ecosystem.

## XI. LEGAL & RISK (The Compliance Vault)
