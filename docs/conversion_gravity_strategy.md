# Conversion & Gravity Strategy: High-Utility Tools

This document defines the tools designed to capture attention and convert it into habitual platform usage. Traffic is not the goal; **Habit is the goal**.

## 1. High-Utility Lead Magnets
These are "bookmarkable" assets that operators and brokers return to constantly.

-   **Oversize Rate Map**: Interactive national map showing regional demand and hot corridors.
-   **Heavy Haul Staging Map**: High-capacity parking index (e.g., 150+ spots) for over-dimensional staging.
-   **"Where The Money Is" Report**: Quarterly intelligence on infrastructure and energy projects.
-   **New Escort Starter Kit**: Equipment checklists, certs, and pricing scripts to grow supply.
-   **Broker Oversize Pricing Guide**: A safety net for brokers to prevent underpricing.

## 2. The Interactive Rail (Traffic Monsters)

Calculators create psychological ownership. Users input their data ➡️ They get a decision ➡️ They enter our workflow.

| Tool | Focus | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Feasibility Calculator** | Brokers/Carriers | Input: Dims/Weight/Route ➡️ Output: Permit Likelihood & Escort needs. |
| **Escort Income Calculator** | Supply | Input: Miles/Rates ➡️ Output: Annual profit projection. |
| **Deadhead Cost Calculator** | Supply | Visualizing the "Hidden Cancer" of empty miles. |
| **Permit Cost Estimator** | Brokers | Quoting safety net for specialized loads. |
| **Trip Profit Calculator** | All | Net profit after all transport constraints. |
| **Opportunity Scanner** | Supply | ZIP-based view of billion-dollar infrastructure projects. |
| **Route Risk Score** | Compliance | A-F grading of a specific lane based on bridge/height risks. |

## 3. Lead Magnets (Authority & Trust)

High-utility assets that get bookmarked and shared organically.

- **Oversize Rate Map**: Interactive heatmap of regional demands and pricing.
- **"Where The Money Is" Report**: Quarterly intelligence on energy/industrial clusters.
- **New Escort Starter Kit**: Checklists, gear needs, and pricing scripts.
- **Broker Oversize Pricing Guide**: Fear-prevention tool for freight agents.
- **Deadhead Reduction Playbook**: Operational efficiency for the solo-operator.

## 4. The Distribution Partner Rail (Influence Aggregation)
We do not recruit "affiliates"; we hand-pick **Distribution Partners** who already influence the operator decision-cycle.

| Partner Type | Strategic Offer |
|---|---|
| **Permit Services** | Recurring revenue + Credibility association. |
| **Escort Schools** | "The Reliability Standard" as a graduate requirement. |
| **Insurance Brokers** | Data to reduce premium risk modeling. |
| **Equipment Suppliers** | Co-branded authority & hardware bundles. |

**Outreach Style**: Calm, executive-style hand-picking. No "Internet Marketer" energy. 50 high-leverage partners is the limit for Phase 1.

## 5. The Path to Habit
1.  **Calculator** (Attention) ➡️
2.  **Lead Magnet** (Permission) ➡️
3.  **Distributed Partner Offer** (Trust) ➡️
4.  **Workflow Tool / The Standard** (Institutional Dependence).
