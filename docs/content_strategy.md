# High-Authority Content Strategy: The HeyGen Rail

This document defines the strategy for the **Phase 17: Content Dominance** layer, using HeyGen for long-form automation and influence-based distribution.

## 1. The Content "Pusher" (HeyGen Automation)

We use **HeyGen** to automate long-form Industry Intelligence content.

-   **Model**: High-authority AI avatars (using the founder's likeness or a "Command General" persona).
-   **Output**: 10-15 minute deep-dives into industry shifts: "The 2026 Solar Farm Logistics Outlook," "How to Price Wind Projects."
-   **Distribution**: Automated push to the "Omni-Channel" rail.

## 2. Omni-Channel Social Grid (The Channel List)

We post automatically to every node in the heavy-haul attention graph.

| Channel | Format | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **FB Page** | Authority Posts / Rules | **Google Discovery** (Public Funnel) |
| **FB Group** | Community / Marketplace | **Facebook Dominance** (Engagement) |
| **LinkedIn** | Deep Dives / Whitepapers | Decision Maker (Broker) Trust. |
| **Reddit** | Industry Debates / Q&A | Community Authority (High SEO). |
| **Pinterest** | Equipment / Mounting Cards | Visual SEO Traffic source. |
| **YouTube** | Project Radar / How-To | Evergreen Video SEO. |
| **Medium** | Industry Intelligence | High-DA Backlinks & Thought Leadership. |

## 3. The Influence Model: Gordon & Hernandez

We model our distribution and conversion after **Cole Gordon** (High-Ticket Sales) and **Aaron Hernandez** (Remote Closers).

-   **The Remote Closer Rail**: Automated triage of inbounds from content, handed off to trained industry closers.
-   **The Appointment Engine**: Content creates leads ➡️ Bots qualify ➡️ Humans close the "Command Suite" subscriptions.

## 4. Key Content Themes (SEO & Trust Monsters)
- **Corridor Guides**: "Best Routes for Wind Components through Texas."
- **State-by-State Rule Centers**: Evergreen SEO deep-dives into jurisdiction quirks.
- **Gear Guides**: "What escorts actually need vs. what salespeople push."
- **Project Intelligence**: Billion-dollar refinery and solar construction radar.
- **Daily AI Podcast**: 5-minute summaries of regulatory changes.

## 5. Topic #1: The "Dispatch Trap" (Authority Pillar)
*Score: 9.5/10 — Blue-Collar Approved*

**Concept**: "Why dispatch won't call you back (even if you're certified)."

| Component | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **The Hook** | "Most new escorts think if they did the job and got paid, they’re good. That’s not how repeat calls actually work." |
| **Avoid the Tone Risk** | Frame as **"Insider Info"** mapping expectations, not a lecture on failure. Tone: Neutral, procedural, practical fixer. |
| **The "Kill Points"** | Radio etiquette, late/early staging, sloppy flagging, unprofessional appearance. |
| **Search Intent** | "why can't I get pilot car jobs", "no repeat escort work". |
| **Browse/Shorts** | "This one radio mistake will get you blacklisted fast." |

**Strategic Value**: This content defines "Operational Expectations," setting the stage for future Haul Command **onboarding standards** and **vetting systems**.

## 6. Topic #2: The "Pre-Move 10-Question Check" (The Shield)
*Score: 9/10 — High Utility Magnet*

**Concept**: "The 10 questions every escort MUST ask before saying 'Yes' to a load."

| # | Question | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Legal or Permitted? | Verify over-dimensional or superload status immediately. |
| 2 | Exact Dims & Weight? | Height, width, length, axle count — no guesses. |
| 3 | States & Permits? | Verify if permits are already pulled or pending. |
| 4 | Required Positions? | Lead, chase, high-pole, utility, police requirements. |
| 5 | Travel Restrictions? | Night travel, curfews, or holiday restrictions. |
| 6 | Real Route? | Bridge heights, weight limits, construction detours. |
| 7 | Equipment Needs? | Signage, lights, poles, radios — state-specific compliance. |
| 8 | Real Rate? | Flat vs. Mile, wait time, hotel, deadhead, cancellations. |
| 9 | Real POC? | Who is the decision maker when it goes sideways? |
| 10 | Risk Tolerance? | Weather, fatigue, night driving, sketchy routes. |

**Strategic Value**: This is the ultimate **"Checklist Lead Magnet."** It builds immediate trust by protecting the operator's CDL and wallet.
