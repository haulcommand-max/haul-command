TITLE: Antigravity Can Now Auto-Clip 1 Video Into 100 Shorts (Here's How)
ID: 88493488-c549-4868-883c-60acf8debfc9

anti-gravity can now clip hundreds of shorts on autopilot so whenever yourself or your client uploads a long form youtube video this system will analyze that content cuts the best clips adds subtitles formats everything for vertical and schedules them for publishing to whichever social media platform that you want and this entire system i built without writing a single line of code no dragging and dropping and configuring of nodes i just spoke to anti-gravity told it what i wanted and it built the whole thing for me and as you can see this is not simply a one-of- demo this is the actual system we use for our own content and in this video i'm going to show you exactly how this clipping system works and the exact process i followed so that you too can build it yourself let's get started hey if you're new here my name is jay i spent a decade in creative and marketing work and half a decade leading data teams and now founded our ai solutions group and robonuggets our education arm where we have several hundred members all ai practitioners across the globe and here our mission is to make creating with ai easy to learn regardless what your background is with a wealth of lessons that most people join for but most members stay because of the community that we have built all right let me show you what the finished system looks like before we get into how i built it and at least for me the way i chose to set it up is via telegram where if i send this telegram agent this youtube url it's now going to process that video it's going to tell me roughly how long it takes and you can see here that i've got confirmation that it is now processing and you can also set this up by the way so it triggers automatically every time you upload a new video so that's entirely up to your preference and with the aentic platforms that i'll show later that's pretty easy to set up but right now since i'm going back to some older content i'm just sending urls here directly and when it's done it sends me an air table link and i can open this up on my desktop or on my phone through the air table app and here i can now see all the clips that it generated for me that it's ready for review i can just watch this and go through them and approve the ones i like just so there's a qa or quality assurance process of me being able to find the right clips that i want to upload and let's say i approved these two and if i go back to my telegram agent and say that i'm done reviewing what it will do is scoop up all of those approved clips schedule them for autopublishing to the social platform that i wanted which in this case is youtube shorts and mark them as ready so now if i go to my scheduling tool which is potato in this case you can see that those two shorts have just been scheduled in my queue and again this human in the loop review step is completely optional honestly if you want to skip it you can if you wanted to just go straight to autopublishing everything or auto scheduling it straight to whichever social platform you want that's absolutely an option but for most content businesses at least in my experience they're going to want to review the shorts first before publishing and so that's what i'll be showing you how to set up today and the reason i think it's worthwhile for you to learn this skill and also watch this tutorial is because previously to build an automation system like the one i just showed you'd either have to code it yourself or architect it in no code builders like nadn or mate.com which still takes time and a lot of technical skill or you can hire a developer and easily spend three to four figures getting all of that set up but what's interesting is that now with aentic platforms like anti-gravity or clawed code or even codeex by openai you can build this whole thing just by talking to your agents which i'll show later in the setup and this whole process that i'm about to show you is the same regardless of which platform you're on so if you already have a subscription on openai then just use cex if you have one for cloud code just use that or if you have a gemini subscription then anti-gravity's default agents is probably what you would use and also in case you're not aware there's already a real market for clipping content like this if you think about custom shorts editing that goes for around $25 per clip for polish or custom work but even for more automated outputs like what you just saw you can still comfortably charge $10 to $20 per short depending on who you're talking to because honestly the client doesn't really care how it was made they care that it's done and it looks good and also if you're watching this and you're part of the community remember that you can just grab this entire agent package from the group import it to whichever agenda platform that you want and when you ask it to start this agent it'll guide you through the setup and you'll be able to use it almost immediately but if you want to build it out from scratch here is basically the exact process that i use to build this and it's flexible enough to use for other agentic automation workflows too it's a very simple step-by-step process that's called the build framework and the start of this process is very simple because all you really need to do is to understand how you can brief the request to your agent and if you haven't used an agent management platform like antiggravity before it's actually very simple because when you think about agents you really just need to think about them as your digital employees and when you work with your employees what you effectively need are just two things a way to share files with them and a way to message them so that you can give tasks well that is exactly how the anti-gravity interface is set up where you have all of the files that you are working on with your agents here at the left and you have the capability to message your agents here at the right and so if we hop over to anti-gravity you can see i have all of my files that i've been working on here for this agent and the great thing about this tool by google is that it's actually quite flexible so of course you can use the native anti-gravity agents here if you prefer which already has access to different models like opus 4.6 released just a few days ago but let's say you have a cloud subscription instead and you want to use cloud code you can actually install that as an extension within anti-gravity as well or if you have an open aai subscription instead you can also opt to use codeex so no matter what your subscription is then i think you can definitely try out these agentic platforms yourself and now really to start creating something literally what you just need to do is to start talking to it so to give an example hey can you create a plan for me i basically make educational content on youtube and what i want is an automation that converts my long- form videos into shorts that i can approve before they get published so that is a pretty simple request and you can just fire that off in order to start working with your agent and once it's done thinking through that what it will now give you is this implementation plan which if you open that that will just give you its plan of attack regarding how to implement this automation which you can now review line by line here by providing comments now interestingly since i've been working with anti-gravity for quite a while now you can see that it has some knowledge already around my preferred tools which is why it was able to give me some tools here that i think i would want to use now if you're just starting out this may not be present for you and so a good skill to have when it comes to briefing these agents is to have crystal clear clarity on exactly what you want now this is actually very similar to how you would approach it whenever you need to brief a technical person and at least when i was doing product and brand management before one very useful framework or mental model that i was using in order to make sure that every aspect of the brief is covered is a simple 5w model so you basically give clarity to the person that you are briefing who is this for what exactly we're trying to build when should it run and how is it triggered where does the output go why this matters so that the other person has context on why we're building this in the first place and as much detail as you can around the how which are the tools that you want to use if you have a preference and if not then you can just have your agent or your technical person suggest options for you so this is a really simple model that you can use just to make sure that you have a checklist in your head that you are giving your agent enough information to exactly build out the workflow that you want to the specification that you need it and to provide an example you can just tell your agent that comment specifically hey so can you revise this implementation plan just with these additional details so we're building this for an educator on youtube who does a lot of content around ai education and as mentioned what we want is an automation that converts the long- form videos into shorts when should it run so whenever it's requested so really i want to be able to have a telegram bot that is connected to this automation so that whenever i send a youtube url to it and the specific number of clips that i want i'll be able to get that output back where should it be stored so i want to use air tableable as our database in order to handle the storage of those clips as well as the approval so that i can review it on mobile with the air tableable app and how it should work is through those tools that i just mentioned but apart from telegram and air tableable i do want to get some options around the best clipping tools out there that can handle this sort of automation so you can be as specific as you want and if you notice you don't necessarily need to answer each of those questions but it's just good to be specific if you already have some specs and to also be transparent on which parts you need optionality for and by the way while that is processing a very handy tip when working with these agents is to use a transcription app which is basically how i'm able to speak and the agent just transcribes everything that i'm saying there's multiple options here i think the market leader is probably whisper flow although the one i'm using is aqua voice but if you're on windows if you hit windows h that will actually bring in the native windows speech service that will just let you use your voice and type that into text so once you've briefed your agent most likely what'll happen is you might need to make some decisions on the tooling that you will need to use and so the next step in this process is for you to understand what your options is so if we go back to the implementation plan that anti-gravity gave us you can see there are now a few recommendations here around the clipping tools that we are able to use so you can see we have vizard we have opus clip clap submagic and a couple of other options now if you're after this specific automation of turning long form into shorts what's best for you to actually do is to just try out these tools yourself especially since a lot of these apps like for example opus clip they do give you a free trial to just paste in a youtube video here and then you'll be able to observe and see if the clips that they generate are fit for your use case and this is important in this domain because if you think about cutting long- form videos into shorts each long- form video is actually quite different and so whatever ai systems that each of these tools are using may perform differently depending on your content so to give an example this is one test and it's complex because if you look at the original video there's multiple faces and so you really need to check if the shorts that tools like oppus clip will create will be fit for whatever it is that you're looking for and so here coming from the test that i did i think oppus clip actually did this pretty well but when i tried it for my videos which are a completely different nature they are mostly screen share explainers like the one that you're seeing now you can see that i think even though it was able to do some face detection the way it cropped everything as well as the screen here at the top doesn't really do it for me i also tried submagic because anti-gravity recommended that as well but i think it actually performed worse at least for my videos because it wasn't able to properly detect that i'm doing a screen share and so a lot of the content really is being cut so not really ideal for me and so after having tested these out i think the one that worked best for me for my specific content is vizard.ai so again not affiliated with them whatsoever but you can see here that apart from the content itself that i screen share being visible i'm able to show myself here and even add a logo and this is i believe quite unique to vizard at least at the time of this recording where when you try vizard which you can do again for free you can click on edit here and you can make any changes to this specific video you can change the layout if you want to these presets that they have and even move things around if you wish including the subtitles including the logo itself and once you're done you can just hit templates and save this as a template so you can see i have a couple here and once you do that you can actually just use this template id to use for your automation and you can feed this to anti-gravity so that the automation that it will build will be using this template whenever we use vizard services now just to mention it in case you want to explore this there's actually an alternative open- source option for you to automatically clip videos from your shorts it's called ffmpeg which you can just ask your agents to explain that to you but they're basically an open- source video editing framework that has been around for like 20 plus years already and they essentially allow you to for example take a video and produce output like this so you can see i have my talking head here cropped in a circle i have the original video here and then i have a zoomed-in video at the top and so to get to this framing you can see i basically just ask anti-gravity to give me different versions up until i get to this point and the great thing about ffmpeg is that it is free unlike those other tools which require you to do a monthly subscription however for you to use ffmpeg it is going to be a lot more complex which again you can just ask your agent why that is but to give you a background ffmpeg when you use it it's practically blind so it doesn't really have face detection technology the same way that vizard or opusclip has and you will also need to separately build out some capability to autodetect potential viral moments from within your long- form video which tools like vizard and opus clip already has out of the box however that is an option for you to take if in case you think that works for you so at this point you've now briefed your agent it's researched your options and you've picked out the specific tool that you're going to use now before you go any further what you need to do is to test it and actually inspect the output that it gives you because for most people especially if you're rushing through building your automation it's the step that most people skip but i assure you that it's the one that will save you a lot of headache down the line because the worst case scenario is you automate something that is actually broken and so it's just a good practice to run this once first before you implement the automation itself and so to do this you can simply ask your agent to do it hey so from those options i think vizard.ai ai would work best for me so can you try and call on their service and send this youtube url and i want three clips in return using this specific template id and here we'll just give it the video that we want to shorten and then back at vizard i'll just copy the template id here and provide that to anti-gravity and when you fire that off it's going to assess what are the requirements for you to run this if you already have a vizard api in your workspace it'll probably go and find that which you can see here because i already did this earlier is looking at my previous vizard conversations in order to see if you have all the requirements set and so what i just did here to help you out and so that you can see what will happen i just ask this instance to assume that they're a new agent with no visitors set up yet and then essentially what it will do is guide you on how to implement this so this is most likely what you'll see if you are starting to build this agent from scratch what it is doing is searching for visitor.ai looking for their api documentations and creating a plan to complete the task that you just gave it so for a lot of these services whether you're using opus clip or submagic what you will need to do is to get your api key in those accounts and it's saying here that it's going to make two api calls one to submit the request and the other is to check or get the shorts once they are ready but a lot of those are actually already going to be handled by the agent and if it spits out a lot of information here you can actually ask it to just summarize what it is that it needs so you can see here that it is asking for my api key and to get your api key usually that would be just in the settings most likely under account and there you go under api this is where you'll find your api key and when you send that to your agent if you're concerned about security since you're doing this all locally meaning this software is actually in your computer itself it's pretty low risk but if you just ask it to store this api key securely what it will actually do is suggest how to do that and the best practice when it comes to these tools is that they will store it in aenv file which is just a text file honestly but it's just a standard across the internet to treatenv files as more secure so it's like a special file extension that developers have agreed that people and websites like github for example have applied default security measures around so once that is good what is now going to happen is anti-gravity is going to tell you that it has everything it needs in order to go ahead so we can just let it do that and it's now going to submit that request for you so you don't need to configure any http request nodes you don't need to set up a polling mechanism via any drag and drop interface what it's now going to do is to build you out that tool which is basically just code in essence under the hood that will let it submit the youtube url that you had and pass it along to vizard in order to create those three clips that we requested it for and you can see here what it created is this vizard clipper py which is a python script and treat that as sort of the workflow in this case and if you open that that's all just code right and honestly you don't need to understand this code any longer unless you are working on a really high-risk project a lot of the code here is already abstracted and the models that are available now are already good enough that you can pretty much just let it fire up until it gets to a point that it's able to fix itself so you can see there are a few errors here but what it's happening really is it is actually fixing itself without me even having to do anything so a lot of that debugging that you are experiencing with drag and drop tools you can just offload that into llm models like what we're doing here now and there we go now it seems to have debugged everything and it tells me that it is working and it also gave me those three clips along with the links so if you click on the output that it gave you so we can just play this just to inspect it but if you to hop back on our dashboard that we created earlier you can now see for anti-gravity is now finished coding that web page yeah that works so you can see it used the template pretty low resolution here at least under preview but when you actually export it you can export it at 1080p resolution which is exactly what we need and you can see since i asked for three clips we have two other clips here that we can also inspect in the same way and i can't emphasize this enough but this is the part where you actually need to look at the output and see if it's good enough for you because what these agents are really good at doing is making sure that everything works but they're not really that good yet in determining if their output is actually good or passing in terms of quality and that's the taste component that you as the human in the loop would bring into the picture because even though it works technically your ai can't actually judge if this particular video or whatever output that you are after is good for yourself or for your client but cool so you've tested the core pipeline now and the output looks good now it's time to zoom out and design the full system which is the endto-end flow from trigger to delivery and so that is what we'll be doing where we'll be laying out the full workflow so that our ai agent can understand what it is that we want as a user experience whenever we run this automation and here's where your skill as a systems design thinker would play a big role because the way that ai agents are so advanced now you actually don't need to sit down and architect complex apis to map out which ones talk to each other and which services need to be wired to a telegram and all of that all you need to do is to be very clear on what the flow looks like so you can see this one is literally what i gave my anti-gravity and it's very very simple i made it in like powerpoint in like 2 minutes because essentially what i really want as a user in this case is i want my agent to live in telegram where whenever i send a link of a youtube video in that telegram bot that now serves as my trigger and obviously you can change this right so if you want it to automatically get the video as soon as you upload it then that's an option too you can feed that to your agent it will most likely suggest like an rss feed type of setup but if you or your client needs a bit more control and since a lot of my personal agents live on telegram then this is a trigger that works for me and then what i want to happen is whenever i send that link it passes that onto vizard api which is the one that we just did and once those clips are generated i actually want all of those clips put to air table which is sort of like google sheets where me as the reviewer will be able to preview the video i'll be able to find the title i'll be able to check what caption that vizard recommended as well as a status because once this is done my telegram bot will just say that the shorts are ready and to check it in air table along with the link to that database and so if you look at our final output here that i showed earlier that's literally what it built right so i have this telegram agent where i just send it a youtube url along with how many clips that i want it built out this response system where it's telling me that it's currently processing how many minutes it usually takes just to set my expectation on how long to wait and then once that vizard project is created it also updates me and when those shorts are ready it gives me the link to air table so that if i'm on mobile i can actually open this in the air table app as well i can review them myself and so for you to set that up it's as simple as taking a screenshot of this or you can actually write this down on paper and take a photo of it send that to antiggravity and ask it to build it for you so for example hey so this is the flow that i'm thinking about now can you analyze this and come up with an implementation plan on how you can build this out and any clarifying questions that you have let me know so that we can build it out together it's probably best to change this to planning since this can be a complex task depending on the model that you are using and there you go once it's done it now has this implementation plan along with a highle architecture of what it's going to do and it also summarized for me what the big requirements are so when you set this up yourself it's quite easy for you to just interact with your agent for them to guide you through this so for example hey can you guide me on how to set up telegram as well as to get those air table base and api tokens and it will lay out step by step how to set those up for you if you are planning to use telegram and air table as well it's really rather simple all you need to do is to create a new bot over a telegram by messaging the bot foder which anti-gravity also gave us a link for and if i just type in new bot you'll now be asked to just name this bot which we can do and once that is done it will give you this api key for your bot which you can just copy into anti-gravity so this is my telegram bot and antigravity will do the work in connecting to that telegram agent and then the next one is air table so this is my air table database you can see it's just similar to google sheets but the difference is you can preview the videos directly here and what your agent basically needs to connect to your air tableable database is this base id which is the very first piece of text right after air table.com so we just give that to anti-gravity and then the second thing is the api key or the personal access token so that's available just in this link where when you create a token all you need to do is to give it the right scopes if you're not sure i'll just add all of these here because i think that is essentially what anti-gravity would require and then if you just want to give a specific access to one base you can do that there or if you want to add all of the resources so that it has access to everything you can just click add resources and create a token and once you have those three you can just send this to adigravity and it will do all of the piping for you to build out that workflow and when you send that out antiggravity will build this whole workflow for you and again produce this py file which if you want to inspect it be my guest but it is just a long piece of python script that does everything that you ask it to and then you can see here that what i did is to test it out once again so i gave it the youtube url that i want to test out as well as the template id and then for this one i didn't give it a limit of the number of clips that i want and so what it said here is that the pipeline test was successful here's what happened and vizard process our video and returned 31 clips just from that one api call that it did automatically and when i go to air table i was also able to confirm that those 31 clips have been processed and put here for my review but now that we've confirmed that that works how do you now take these videos and actually schedule them for publishing because ideally the workflow that i want is at least in the beginning while i'm testing this out i want to review these videos and when they are approved i would mark this as approved and then another workflow will just grab all of the videos that i approved and autochedu them for my social channels and so to build out that second workflow it's the same thing you literally just need to map out what it is that you want to happen so you can see here that what i just described i quickly built out again in powerpoint where my trigger is on the same telegram bot when i say i'm done reviewing that just triggers this workflow where it pulls all of those clips that i've marked as approved and scheduled them for youtube shorts in this tool called potato which i'll discuss in a bit and which we have used extensively before via the next schedule slot and when that is done we will just mark the row as ready in air table so that the next time this runs it doesn't capture that same clip for rescheduling again and so to build that out it's the same process i just gave it that same workflow that same system and ask it to plan out how to build this workflow where basically it will get the air table inputs and so on and so forth it will begin to plan everything and by the end of it it will build out those python scripts for you which are the automations themselves that will process everything it will also ask you to set up your potato account with it which basically just involves giving it your api key as well as your account id and if you haven't used potato before it's essentially an autopublishing tool what's good about it is that you can add specific schedule slots on where you want your posts to go live so you can see here i have it set to post four times a day and all i need to give to antiggravity is my api key which you can find in settings here under api and it's also asking for our youtube user account id which you will get if you log in with youtube here because i'm planning to upload to youtube shorts and once you get that you can just paste that to anti-gravity obviously if you're planning to auto post as well to these other platforms it's just a matter of you logging in to those platforms or accounts and copying the account ids and giving those to anti-gravity so when i gave those parameters to anti-gravity you can see here that what is now done is actually try and schedule one clip it actually read the documentation of potato and figured out how to send a request through this python script that it just made and when that is confirmed it says clip one is scheduled if i go back to blue potato and look at calendar here in my comic posts i can see that the clip has been scheduled automatically for me and if i go back to anti-gravity you can see that it has been marked as ready which means that it's been scheduled via bluetooth so that tells me that the workflow that we built with it is working well so now we're ready to move on to the last step oh and by the way if it's your first time using plotato remember that we have a discount code that's available for the community in case you're looking to use them for the long term and this final step is simply to deploy it and this is where your project goes from something running on your own laptop within anti-gravity to a real system that's living in the cloud which means even if you have your computer shut down and anti-gravity is off then you can actually trigger your agent to do your work for you because up until now everything we've built has been running locally which means inside anti-gravity and that's fine for testing but if you want this to run on autopilot or if you're building this for a client then it needs to live somewhere that is always on right and there's actually multiple ways to do this and you can obviously ask your ai agent again on which one is best for your specific scenario but one of the easiest that i can recommend is this tool called modal and again we're not affiliated with it but what it is is sort of like renting a computer in the cloud that only turns on when you need it and so that way it is economical for you because you're not paying for a server or a computer that is running 24/7 it only spins up or goes live when a clip needs processing it does the work and then shuts back down when it's done and when you sign up to it they actually give you $5 in credits which will last you a long long time and then once you verify with credit card details they make that into $30 and the way that you deploy this is really rather simple so again i just ask anti-gravity to deploy our project to model and i ask it to guide me on how to do this and now it's working through some kinks in order to set that up and it will likely ask you for your api key for model once again in order to connect to it seamlessly and the way you get that from within model is again just from settings if you head to api tokens you can create a new token in here and you can just send that to anti-gravity and when it's deployed it will confirm that for you if you want to inspect it here at models's dashboard you can actually find this live application that will run whenever you trigger it and so now the final step is to just test it out if i go back to telegram and let's say i want three clips of this specific video what it should now do is receive that for us it now confirmed that it is processing so even without anti-gravity this should run because this is the modal server that is processing this workflow now for us it confirms to me that the vizard project has been created and it's now checking every minute if those clips are ready and there we go it now confirmed that those three clips are generated in air table it gave me the link so that i can go to that and we now have those logged in here which i can review let's watch this one so let's say you have a more complicated workflow and for some reason there is one or two nodes so that looks pretty good and i think that is good to go and let's say i reviewed all of the shorts that needs approval for this video i can just go back to my agent here on telegram say that i'm done reviewing them and what it will do is run that workflow on checking our air table database for the approved clips and immediately it scheduled them to plot so let's just double check well first of all at least on air table you can see it just marked those as ready live in real time and here at plotato let me just refresh that and now it's scheduled that specific clip onto the next slot so that is exactly what we wanted and just to show some examples of clips going live this one fired off like 30 minutes ago as i was recording this tutorial and it already got 360 views and that was done automatically by our agent so there you go that's the end to- end process for building aic workflows using anti-gravity and hopefully you can see that this is a genuinely useful system that you can offer as a service to content businesses or use it to scale your own now if you want the straightest path to building this yourself all the promps of use are available for free the link to our network group is just down below and if you're watching this and you're already part of the community then you can grab that entire agent as a template import it into any agentic platform that you like and it will walk you through the setup step by step and if you want to go deeper if you want real training on how to build
