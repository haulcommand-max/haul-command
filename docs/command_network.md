# Heavy Transport Command Network: The Decision Engine

This document defines the architecture for a "Decision-First" network that replaces passive directory browsing with active market coordination.

## 1. Decision Triage (The "Command" Layer)

Instead of a generic list, the network is optimized for the **"Hero Shot"** decision: *“Who should I hire RIGHT NOW for this $450K load?”*

### Intelligence Profiles
- **The Identity Graph**: A living history of every company.
- **Reliability Indicators**: Automated on-time rates, cancellation history, and specialized load counts.
- **Geographic Density Heatmaps**: Shows where vendors *actually* operate, not just their office address.

## 2. Decision Categories (The Constraint Map)
We segment the network by the **operational pain** they resolve:
1. **Escort Rail**: Lead/Chase + Superload Steer Car operators.
2. **Compliance Rail**: Permit Agencies & Regulatory Consultants.
3. **Authority Rail**: Police/LE Coordination contacts.
4. **Utility Rail**: Bucket Truck / Line Lift vendors.
5. **Engineering Rail**: Route Surveyors & Structural Analysts.
6. **Recovery Rail**: specialized heavy rotators.

## 3. The Availability Engine (Real-Time Liquidity)
- **Operational Toggles**: Operators set status to `Available`, `Booked`, or `Limited`.
- **Capacity Signals**: AI predicts "Likely Available" status based on recent trip completions.

## 4. Expansion Model: Corridor Dominance
We do not launch nationally. We saturate **Corridors** to create density-driven habits.
- **Priority 1**: Texas Triangle (Energy/Refinery).
- **Priority 2**: Midwest Manufacturing Belt (Aerospace/Industrial).
- **Priority 3**: Southeast Freight Lanes (Port-to-Inland).
- **Priority 4**: Alberta/Ontario Cross-Border (Infrastructure).

## 5. Trust Accelerators
- **Verified Vendor Badge**: Automated credential/insurance/safety audit.
- **Decision API**: Enterprise access for shippers to find "Clean Pipe" vendors instantly.

**Status**: PLANNING
**Goal**: Make the platform unavoidable through Trusted Decisioning.
