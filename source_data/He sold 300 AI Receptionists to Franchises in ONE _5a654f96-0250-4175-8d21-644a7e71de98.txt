this is one of these cases where don't always listen to your customer when you show a enterprise client they're not in this marketing echo chamber where we think like everyone knows about it the high level is really meant for small businesses we are really redefining that now fortune 500 Fortune 100 companies i've talked to people work there how many have you signed up in the last 6 8 months you have an engineering team that's rolling out 10 to 15 agents a day and you are using High Level's native AI features for all of these rollouts right yep welcome back to the latest segment on this channel where we talk about what's working right now to get clients using High Level in this one I'm sitting down with my friend Fur Patel who if you don't know worked for High Level for a year helping them roll out troubleshoot and make the voice AI inside of High Level actually usable for agencies so if there's anyone that knows about voice AI it's fur and what's really cool about him is he's using the native highle voice AI and rolling it out to enterprise and franchise level clients and not only in this video does he go over how to get those clients he goes over more importantly his exact process for building deploying testing and troubleshooting voice AI agents all inside of High Level which is in my opinion the most valuable part of this interview and if there's anybody that's qualified to give advice on this it's Fur let's get into it fur Patel welcome to the show man great to be here seen you around for a while you know it's first time actually connecting with you online yeah this is great uh so you put a post up that absolutely blew my mind about a month ago so I don't know if you know this story but I lived about 10 minutes away from Scipio's headquarters if you don't know what Scipio is it's like a B2B texting app that was not the first of its kind but very early days and I live in Utah they're headquartered in Utah and I was like looking for an internship this is before I got into the whole agency space i was like trying to figure out what to do but I went to Scipio's headquarters and I like talked to somebody was nice enough to sit down with me and like give me a couple ideas i think it was a guidance counselor at my university told me like "Oh I I know someone there you should go talk to her." And she was like "I have no idea what you should do you should talk to this guy." And then I never got to talk to that guy but I went there and then I heard the name Scipio from Rob Bailey over and over and over again if you don't know Rob he's like the first agency owner coach that invited High Level's co-founders out and helped them get their first like hundred customers basically and he was using Scipio previously and the the story goes that he was paying a lot for their texting and High Level was able to you know cut a ton of that cost and he tells the story over and over again and you know rumblings I don't know a couple years ago year two years ago people start to say to Rob like hey can you can you not like tell that story anymore because you know rumor has it that Skippy is a highle client and I didn't know that until I saw your post and your post was "Hey Scipio is using Highle's AI technology that by the way Fur helped develop and deploy and roll out when he worked at High Level for a year and they are rolling it out to enterprise level clients like we'll put a bunch of brands on the screen you'll see the post from from FUR uh but literally like these are corporate level very successful venture-backed franchises one of them was like a a hospital association right these are not your mom and pop chiropractors dentists and med spas that everybody always talks about these are real businesses and I think there's this sort of uh sentiment that floats around the high level community at least for me where it's like yeah this tech is good but it's not good enough to roll out at a you know corporate level you'd have to do something else if you were going to sign up some big franchise or whatever and you are using High Level's native AI features for all of these rollouts right yep all high level and you I think you said you like you thought you might need to use another third party tool and then you were like "Nah I think we're good." We actually did use a third party tool to build on for a bit hyo rolled out what we needed and we now migrated everything back we don't need to use a third party anymore amazing and how many of these like big clients do you have at the on Scipio like now aka Rapid Talk AI which is their you know new new AI brand how many have you signed up in the last I don't know six eight months since you've been at Scipio so I've been at Scipio since July myself oh okay but kind of blend names still together here scipio we call it Scipio Classic internally so we have existing enterprise legacy customers on Scipio that are well known in the industry name it people know them they've been on the platform for 10 years plus that's Scipio but now Rapid Talk is bringing the AI portion to Scipio through its acquisition so you know every single day we have rollouts we have an engineering team that's rolling out maybe 10 to 15 agents a day every single day and as part of the process it's we've taken our AI rollout process and turn into a bit of like a development process we have the sales team they roll hand it over to the development team development team deploys the agent then we hand over to our QA team to do some quality checks make sure the phone number set up correctly the voice uh the voice um recording is enabled the transcripts are on the emails are being sent out the workflows are going out we have a whole checklist we got to go through and then we hand it back over to the sales team to follow the client so it's a it's a process that we have in place that is growing and it's you know scaling at a rapid pace but realistically we're talking like 300 to 500 voice AI bots a month built on high level that you guys are rolling out yeah i don't have the exact number honestly but I mean 10 a day would be 300 a month yeah so because the thing is we're going after franchises yeah yeah when we get franchises the first couple of weeks may be slow because now we're working with their proof of concept franchise locations we'll get their feedback we take our time that might be four weeks okay what do they think about it everything's good then at that point say "Yeah we're good to go here's another 50 more." So then we got start we roll it out we start rolling it out and a lot of times you know one of the things people don't realize as well is you don't have to over complicate it keep it simple so and this is one of these cases where don't always listen to your customer because a customer is always going to want more and more and more i wanted to do this i want to handle this i want to do this but you're the consultant in this case here you're the expert you need to know when to push back saying this is the agent that you give them options saying hey you know you have this type of agent do you want this type of agent or do you want this type of agent these are agents that you already pre-built you already tested they've been optimized and they work well yeah then based upon which agent they want then you'll go in there and customize it make it personalized for their own needs change things up make it their own agent at that point but the ones that take you the longest amount of time are the custom buildouts it's not just building out the custom bot itself that's timeconuming maintaining it is a timeconsuming process as well because if something happens or there's an edge case that happens on it it didn't work well the person who built it is the only one who can maintain it so if you have a team and you don't have a standardized process in place if you get feedback no one else can really look at it because it gets complicated unless you start going through it trying to understand it they're not it's not rocket science but it's time consuming if it's not yours or you don't have a standard process so then you got to start going through it and something that would might take someone five minutes to fix because he's the one who built it might take you about an hour hour and a half to figure out because now you need to test it is there something that you need to do that he missed out on or not someone listening who hasn't built one of these before what happens is when you try to add in okay the AI made a mistake in this specific situation this edge case you go in you try to just put that in then it might break something else that sort of conflicts with that you looking at it on on you know surface value you're like no this doesn't conflict should be fine but then you find that it starts having issues elsewhere right for yeah these are things that you might put handles or guard rails in certain places in there that when you're working on it you overlook or it might not be seem like a big deal oh yeah it makes sense you move on not realizing this guardrail is over exerting itself on what you just added so your part's not working like why is it working you not realizing certain things already in place to prevent certain things to happen it happened to me i was going through an agent it was just reading off the date weird so it would just be saying it would say Monday uh hours are from 8:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m tuesday so it just blended the date with the day the next day the next line so I spend time trying to triage it why isn't it working that doesn't make sense because LLMs will break it down as a list so when it's a list it reads it really rapidly i'm like how do I slow it down so I'm adding prompting to slow it down i'm changing things around i'm like this is still not working why not then I went all the way back into some of the guidance we gave and it said literally read it as one continuous sentence like so I just removed that one line and then everything I was doing worked there you go but I wasted about an hour hour and a half trying to fix that cuz I didn't I did not expect to see a line like that in place we removed it it fixed it this is where a lot of times just simplify the offering and a simple offering can sell enterprise clients okay so I have so many questions about this the like delivery side because I think that's so valuable uh but the promise of this video was to help people understand that this technology is actually possible to use with these enterprise grade clients and how they might go about getting those clients because if you've ever dealt with uh small budgets local businesses mom and pop shops who you know have two pennies to rub together but you know they've been running their business the same way for 40 years and they look at you with the side eye versus a very forwardthinking well- capitalized company the sales completely different and they're wellconed they connect you with other people or they have multiple locations like it's just it's a night and day difference so if you can plug into that world this is going to be 10 times easier for you so I want to talk about that but first let's talk about the technology why is it okay to use high level to deliver on these companies that are receiving thousands and thousands of calls and what like you actually as I mentioned worked with high level rolled this out so you know everything about it what else should we know that we maybe don't or maybe overlook or just don't think about uh that would help us have more confidence when we're selling this at a bigger level so I think just to kind of round that part out High Level's all in on AI they're going all in i think they're about hiring another hundred people on the AI team itself so if you want to use High Level in the AI space know that High Level is going in on all all in on AI right now so when I was working there we were still we have an AI product we're rolling out we didn't actually have an AI team per se we didn't have AI expertise we just had developers who are working on AI now High Level is hiring people who are coming from you know enterprise companies who are at the forefront of AI wow bringing in that talent right now and they're finding they're sourcing the best of the best talent right now for AI knowing that everything's going all in on AI hyo is rapidly scaling in every area if you look at the platform it's become super stable in the last little while as well you're not seeing some of the issues that were plaguing us for years a lot of these things are gone because the team has sorted out all these issues here optimized it it's pri and prioritizing it a lot of times it's just you know sometimes it's just the issues happen it becomes normalized it's just part of the dayto-day oh this went down we fixed it no problem because when you're in your own if you want to say echo chamber your own little world you're just doing it you're doing your job moving on people like me and others there would get into that world and say "Hey guys you see how many times we went down in this last month i created a Google sheet just like and kind of made red every time we had an outage to make a point and shoved it in everyone's face you know just just letting you guys know this how many times it went down." But that one illustration is what really got people attention really that many times because when it goes down up down half an hour hour not big deal but when we put it over a course of a month you see how many times went down it becomes very noticeable and people took reaction to it so you had the QA lead saying guys this is not okay this is not okay so everyone realized it sometimes you just need to give a different perspective and that's what I was trying to do when I was there giving different perspectives so a lot of the team And that's even from management level as well everyone top down was saying we need to fix these issues no more that's why we've seen a lot of improvements in last little while and it's only improving right now yeah thank you for that by the way you were saying before to to shout out for he he was saying like he was talking with the product team or the devs as well and you're you're like "Hey you may look at this list of bugs and be like "Oh it's just a bug it's in my queue i'm going to do But like the real people have their entire business built on this if you sign up a customer and they churn then you the cost to acquire that customer and the cost of them leaving in one month like it it's just not sustainable and he he really fought for us as the agency owner so I I you deserve um accolades for that over and over again thank you Fern but that's kind of what I was telling them when I would fight for agency owners and I disagree with them say "Hey look I am the voice of agency owners because I know I just I'm coming from that world." Yeah so when you're a developer you're developing you want to just develop cool stuff i understand that as well but when your cool stuff conflicts with what agency owners want or it breaks or causes problems it's not cool anymore real life consequences i had one client I got on a call with him and he was complaining about a very specific issue very specific edge case for him wasn't working and his whole business was AI on high level so he said "What should I do?" I'm like "Honestly you're asking the wrong guy here but if I was in your position I would shift to someone else right now if your whole business relies upon this one thing and this is what's you know crushing you right now switch to an alternative for now because we're going to fix this in the next 30 days." That's what I've been told but 30 days is a lifetime for your clients they can't afford that but then you know then I worked them through a few other alternative ways of working around it so we got them sorted out but in the end it's just not about you know what's best for high level what's best for the customer that's what I was looking for as well it's huge so yeah and it's I I was talking to Ian head of support if you don't know him he's very behind the scenes but maybe if you're an early high leveler you know him i was talking to him a year ago at the summit and he was like I can finally hear it in Sean's voice like we're going to start focusing on stability this year and like I I know that he's serious about it and I would say like I I kept going back to that conversation in my head every time I saw like complaints about stability in the high level group and you're right like over the summer it seems like that is really lifted and you probably have more internal data about um yeah what actually that it's actually improved like real cold hard data about it um but yeah the the days of you know high level outages every single day on whatever thing are are gone they're a thing of the past yeah it was it was I think it was in early June that I was created a SWAT team like guys this is not okay i was trying to I gave him an example like how do I tell them without being like you know rude or insulting so the example I I drew a parallel like suppose you went to a restaurant your favorite restaurant right i I was trying to give them a analogy suppose you went to your favorite restaurant and you had the greatest experience it was fantastic you love the food then you went back a week later at the same time and it was closed but it should have been open or then you came back a week later they no longer have their favorite item on the menu it's gone or you come back a week later and now you have poor quality food is it going to be your favorite restaurant anymore you're going to move on yeah i go this is what we're doing to our customers we're changing things on them that should not be changing we're breaking things should not be breaking people just have certain expectations should work when it doesn't work what and this is where another way that people need to understand as well is us agency owners on the platform we can understand it we can make excuses we understand the whole skateboard model so we're okay with it to a certain point we're frustrated but we see the benefits of the platform as a whole yeah paying that flat small monthly fee and you're getting all these services like blown away but now your clients will not be forgiving to you they're not they don't believe in the same mantra that we believe in because that's not their job they say like I need a software that works if I log in and my sales pipeline doesn't work my sales guy can't work i'm losing money i'm shifting to another platform it's simple for them no forgiveness in our case we're not gonna switch over to something else right now because we know the value of the platform and what else it can do yeah very cool and tell us a little bit about the underlying technology that the voice AI specifically and high level is built on yes so initially before I joined high level um they were running off a platform called Sinflow sinflow was a top four players of Vappy uh retail there's Sinflow and depending you can build your own using some open source technologies there might be other ones as well but those are the most well-known ones so we're on Sinflow and I guess I don't know what process was that they chose that one but I think it's they were one of the smaller ones that can grow and scale with us accommodate our needs based on what we needed however that also backfires on you when they can't scale at the speed that we need to scale so sometimes we need to roll out a feature we can't roll out that feature because we don't have the API technology or the endpoints or the API integration that we need in order to roll it on our side because our partner doesn't have the connection so a lot of time we need the appointment booking solution back in the day we couldn't do it because we're waiting on them to go to the endpoint that was it we're waiting so then they you know they had scaling issues uh inconsistencies outages and a lot of times when I was there these are the issues that kind of roll onto my head i have to deal with it uh Friday and the worst part is always Friday afternoons that was the worst part friday afternoon something happened because someone checked in some type of code and everything was great and then everything goes down and then I get DMs and I get Slack messages saying "Hey it's not working." what's not working and then they have to triage it it then have to go through a whole triaging process like this is maybe 6:00 at you know Eastern time now I'm debating is it our issue or is it the CL or downstream partners' issue so before I start calling and waking everyone up in India let me do some triaging before I do that then eventually this is not our issue but I can't do anything i need them to communicate with their devs so then I start making the phone calls i remember one time I was calling uh our partners the CEO's phone number non-stop calling calling it's like 3:00 in the morning for calling calling you got to answer that phone we need someone on it because I don't know what you need to do hit a switch just it's not it's down turn it back on that's all I wanted so we work with that partner and you know we all want something we we all want solutions done immediately we're all like that we just like I want it done now it it's hard to be patient in this case here we have to be very patient with this partner because the we were waiting on them a lot of dependencies so eventually I took initiative to start sourcing other alternative partnerships and this is where we ended up partnering with retail AI uh the Vap and retail are the main ones out there uh our director of engineering he flew out to go meet with both of them um in California we ended up vibing better with retail they were more accommodating what we needed they understood the vision we're trying to go and they can move at the space at the speed that we want to go at so we end up working with them and started gradually shifting over our existing agents over to the new infrastructure and the outages has significantly went down i don't I can't remember an outage it's like you don't when things are going as normal status quo you just think that's how it should be so I haven't seen an outage for a while which is great yeah that's that's the world we want to be living in we don't we want to be in a world where it works yes we want to be in a world where things just work as is unfortunately the platform is evolving um a lot as well they're building out a lot of solutions on retail hyo has to do a lot of times people look at things of you know oh you know this person can do it on the same platform why can't you oh that's a smaller company building on the platform versus an enterprise company like high level that has to make sure all the workflows integrate well with it all the other sections within the platform work with it APIs work with it it's not just a simple hey let's do a quick integration two days a smaller company could be two days for high level might take three four weeks because there's a lot more moving parts and even sometimes I would question hey this is an easy fix why can't we do it then I realized hold on we got to involve the phone team here we got to involve the phone infrastructure team oh we got to incorporate the SAS team because all this one little change we're doing has ripples for all these other teams so nothing is done in isolation so we need to bring other teams in and other teams have their own road maps their own priorities so there's a lot of learnings I had to do when I was there as well that things can't be done at a fast pace we think it's very fast when you're looking at the outside because high is releasing things very very fast but they're releasing things across all the different Yeah um feature area but when you're in one department like can we roll out faster we can't sometimes the one one fix I wanted had to wait three months because another team's road map was a priority first and another thing I I like to bring up is like funding if if you're thinking oh High Level's not you know it's only for mom and pop shops they got what was it $120 million from like the the venture firm or uh whatever I can't remember the what's the name of the firm private equity and they're private equity company private equity firm uh and now I can't I'll put it here because I can't remember the name that High Level has that funding and then if you go look up uh retail on CrunchBase like they're Y Combinator backed they've got 11 other investors that are very reputable like we're working with the best of the best when it comes to the tech so and it's a helpful reframe like you're going in there typing in a prompt into the highle voice AI thing and you think oh you know it's it's this rinky dink you know you know it's high level like should work but hopefully it it does because you know I'm signing up a client on this we're really in this this stage of like a new high level very good uh back-end partners and um you know post the post for Patel era where the really understand the agency um so that's really cool anything else you'd add to that conversation before we move on to to closing bigger clients ai has evolved significantly it was a year of learnings on everyone everyone is you know voice AI last year you don't even like what is that should I even do it i'm not sure maybe it's just a fad no one's going to do it now you just call anywhere and they have voice agents rolling out everyone's pushing voice AI agents and it's getting adopted and becoming more mainstream as a solution initially a lot of people push back on when I used to do coaching calls like I don't know they're going to hang up if they know it's a voice AI agent no it's not true a lot of times voice AI agents are more helpful because they'll hang up if the voice AI agent is poorly built it cannot handle it but if it actually is helpful it's designed for purpose and it solves that purpose that you're calling for people are happy with it we have people in the community who build it out for their restaurants so they'll sit there instead of wasting the time of the receptionist asking what's your special what's your this what's your that they'll talk to AI agent for five minutes asking all the questions all right I'm ready to talk to a person now to place the order so now five minutes is saved versus or they spend more time with a voice agent because they ask more questions that you'd feel very rushed to do when you're with with a receptionist it's like okay next okay next yeah that's cool okay so how do I close massive clients for for massive clients enterprise clients it's you have to convey the value proposition to them and don't over complicate it a lot of times we all get excited we want to build this amazing voice AI agent like oh this bot can do this it could do this simplify it keep it simple so we've had the greatest success because it has a very specific purpose so if we're dealing with a gym so one of our franchise clients will deal with a gym and what what's the purpose of we have very specific use cases so someone's calling in I want to know what your hours are like what's your schedule uh or those are the basic questions that people call in for you don't need a person to answer that hey I'll send SMS with their schedule or I will yes we're open right now or we close at this time these are very basic questions anyone can handle then you have other edge you know other questions such as you'll have a personal trainer calling in for you know I'm running late for my class so those are ones that get notified to the front desk immediately we'll have specific rules where we do a human transfer that's based on the client itself but we have very rigid AI agent very specific use case it'll answer very specific type of questions and it has a knowledge base I can refer back to it's like oh do you have a Zumba class yeah we have a Zumba class and it happens you know this many times a day that's just the training the knowledge you're giving it but when you show a enterprise client or a franchise client or a large client keep in mind they're not in the same world we're in they're not in this marketing echo chamber where we think like everyone knows about it everyone must know all about AI and voice AI you'd be surprised if you walk the streets just go talk to people like what do you mean how does it work because this is the biggest issue when people are online and your feed gets inundated with everyone similar to you right so you think everyone's talking about all the Facebook ads you get all about the same thing like no I've talked to people who work at large technology companies like the Nvidia and the Matrix and the large enterprise you know Fortune 500 or Fortune 100 companies i've talked to people work there developers and as well how do you use AI company i don't I might use AI once a week for an email my buddy works at um Empower one of the biggest like banking companies they're out of uh Denver and uh it's the Empower Stadium is I think the Broncos Stadium and he's like "Yeah we're not allowed to use it at all." Like like I I have my personal chat GBT account that I can use for some stuff but like I can't upload data in it i can actually like enable my um every day-to-day process with it and that yeah like the everyday people are aware of some of the chat GPT stuff that's that's available but um yeah same thing every time I talk to somebody and by the way it's always the marketers who think this the voices sound bad all the every run of the the day like the receptionists and the decision makers like wow that sounds amazing sounds so human we are extremely critical of it because we want to sound humanlike but I don't want I don't want to talk to a fake human i want to know I'm talking to an AI agent so a lot of times people are like "Oh what if they think it's you know what if they find out it's voice AI?" I'm like "Hey I'm so and so's virtual AI assistant." Be upfront about it then the expectations when it glitches a little bit it might hesitate it might not see the right answer right away yeah yeah or doesn't have the same inflection people understand that because okay I'm not talking to a human and it's really your competition there is sorry to cut you off there i just I had this epiphany when you said this but like IVRs where you're like "Hey our menu options have changed recently press one for this press two for that." And then you go again on the phone tree four or five times that's what you're competing with and this you can blow that out with a voice AI agent because I can just ask the question and it knows where to go on the phone tree so to speak it's funny i actually had the same conversation with someone last week about how come anytime I call anyone's voice tree it says my menu items have changed no matter what and it's honestly I don't think I've ever memorized anyone's menu item so you make one mistake one time you'll call back and listen like why do you have to tell me that it doesn't make any difference to me so but yeah you're right it's a more efficient IVR so so many times you go down the tree path like "Oh wrong path got to restart okay wrong path." So now it's like "Hey I want to talk to I just want to book an appointment." So back to keeping it simple what is the purpose of your agent what are you trying to do so in our in a few different examples we'll have a is an after hours agent that's a standard use case that everyone can use instead of having it go straight to voicemail and someone leaves a voicemail the next morning receptionist may or may not listen to it right away until lunchtime because they're busy with morning rush what if you had the AI agent saying "Hey how can I help you today?" "Oh I'd like to book an appointment no problem i'll send you the booking link." That's one option or you know you have some questions about such and such they can answer all those questions for you the agent can handle all that and you decide do you want to make it in a way that they have to book an appointment or do you want to just answer questions and someone will call them back and what we do a lot of times is we'll take the transcript of the call that comes in so you get the transcript the whole transcript no one's going to read the whole transcript like honestly if you're an you're someone working at a reception office and you get all these transcripts coming in all the time you're not going to read them so what we do is we will process the transcript analyze it and put into certain buckets saying this person's calling for this reason or this reason or this reason so we choose six different buckets it's a billing issue cancellation issue it's this type of issue and we'll take that reason put it in the email subject and then who it is what their phone number is just so when you're when it's coming in cancellation oh I'll look at that one right away or billing okay I got a building thing or if it's something else okay this someone just had an inquiry a general inquiry i don't need to even look at it waste my time you can start parsing those out because always remember this is what you know if you're only focused on the tech side you're not realizing what the human side is you have receptionist on the other side they're getting all the emails what are they going to do with it all how do you make it useful for them that's what we try doing is we will analyze the transcripts and make it more useful so they can actually take decisions on it or if your agent is saying "Hey someone's going to call you back." Make sure in the title "Call back." Yeah so that one becomes urgent so they actually know someone's going to call them back because so many times we'll have the agent saying "Hey I'm sorry we're closed right now." Um if you just leave your name number and what the reason for your call is someone for our team won't get back to you so how do we make sure someone gets back to them we make sure it's in front and center in the email subject because honestly not everyone's going to you know I've seen transcripts that are five minutes long you're just skimming through it you may miss the point that's relevant for you what I'm hearing in general from you is you don't have to come to these businesses and say "We're going to completely replace your receptionist this is like the best thing since sliced bread." You're like "We're going to give you a marginal improvement on what you can do." Yeah some of it you're going to be blown away by and some of it you're going to be like I wish that was a little bit better right now but it's uh it's basically making your receptionist partially AI partially human because we have to transfer to a human a lot of times but we're saving those man-hour so the things that humans are actually good at they can spend time doing that instead of doing the things that AI is actually better at yeah because a lot of people from a company perspective they feel like oh if you use AI I'm going to lose my job that's just a human reaction but a lot of times is how do we make your job you can become more efficient with your job you can focus on less mundane tasks like yes we're open at this time yes we close at this time or you want to book an appointment sure I'll send you a booking link or I'll take the appointment these are trivial things that you can offload and become more efficient and one other thing I remember speaking to someone who focuses on the plastic surgery niche ironically enough it's very specific niche and I asked him you know he's telling me how how much success he has over there and asked him why are voice AI agents successful for you he's the most important thing for him is the concurrent calls that could come in at the same time you have one receptionist like please hold please hold please hold and then they're people are waiting for 15 20 minutes in the call while they're going through the process What if someone's calling you in just say hey I need to reschedle my appointment or I just want to book an appointment or I just have a question about this these are things that you can train your agent to handle that doesn't need a human involved or it's like oh I have an appointment tomorrow what do I need to do okay if you're you have an appointment for XYZ reason here is what you need to do i can send you the instructions by SMS simple things like that keep it simple concurrency was his major selling point that made a huge difference because one receptionist getting inundated with multiple phone calls at the same time they can't handle it yeah and and you'd be surprised how little the not being able to schedule in a certain software affects the sale and the delivery like nine out of 10 times it's better to just keep it simple be like "No we don't integrate with your software but we can collect all the info that they want treat it as appointment request send it to you your team processes that when they get back from the bathroom or get off the other call." Also have you programmed it like so we've got the concurrent calls we've got I have a friend that does like hey if you don't answer in three rings then it goes to the AI which gets over the objection of like oh I don't want AI answering every call like if we have a human available I want them to perfect but if she's in the bathroom we don't wait for it to ring 10 times before it goes to the AI what other and then you said after hours as well are there any other kind of like places that the AI can plug in or ways that you've configured that that you thought were cool some places they're not ready to fully adopt AI so we call them more like first line of defense the agent will handle the initial call it will answer the questions and then if someone doesn't feel comfortable saying you know I want to talk to someone then we'll transfer them to a human right away based on the request or depending on the industry or what the client wants we can say wait we can let it push back twice say you know what if they say they really want to talk to someone one time then we say are you sure I can help you just ask me your questions I can help you out saying "No I really want to talk someone." Okay transfer you to a human now so we do it we calibrate and they're saying "Okay if they you know push a little more prompting but simplistically if they push back once or they push back twice or three times depending what you want to do then it'll do a human transfer." Very cool and it it's worked effectively well we have some clients who want the AI agent handle all their phone calls because they just can't do it we had one client recently a massage client and for their franchise and they're in and out they're busy they just want someone to answer their questions they want to book an appointment send them a booking link we don't need a human to answer their calls and only if they do someone will call them back so it'll be more we'll take a message and someone will call you back it we won't allow any transfers to happen at all because they don't want that they just want I'll answer your questions if we can't answer it someone will call back and then someone will call back whenever it's convenient for them what is the pitch to these bigger companies obviously it's different because like you're in the ideal situation with Scipio you have a brand you have a list of customers you have sales experience like you have a big team to roll out it's just like here's the tool go run with it but uh so you know people listening to this will have a little bit more to figure out than just the pitch but when I asked okay how do we get in the door with the franchises the big businesses you said keep it simple but how do we actually like get the phone call in the first place what is working for you guys in that area you know our strategy a lot of times has been through conferences or the chamber of commerce meetings the I'm not a big fan of cold calling or reaching out because no one wants that whereas if you can hit up your chamber of commerce I remember one person I was coaching was told go to your chamber of commerce they went there and they demoed the voice agent to them i think that 25 people there and 20 out of 25 people I think that was the number showed extreme interest in learning more because they've never seen it and they saw it and they heard it it just you need to be in the right environment you go to conferences you network you go to these uh big events you show them what you can do be put yourself in positions where you can showcase the product get your foot in the door that way have networking meetings show people if you want to show realistically pitch the clients the larger clients because you're going to email do a cold email i got LinkedIn requests every single day everyone's sending me emails hey you know I can do I just delete the ball i don't even read any of them i'm like I'm not in the I don't want to be pitched about anything so I just literally it comes in if it's I read the subject i don't and I have an idea they're trying to pitch me I just delete it move on because I'm not interested so a lot of these larger companies are in the same position they're not interested but you take them outside of the work environment the email coming in you meet them somewhere check this out what do you think oh wow i didn't know about that so I sent you three emails you know but you didn't check but no just show them a lot of times reputation management we you know it's very similar strategy people all the time like oh you know how do I sell clients i email them all the time like you're emailing clients clients are busy they have no idea where you're emailing them you're selling you're trying to sell them something and all they see is a sales pitch coming in you're not telling them what you're solving for them a lot of times you're not solving a painoint you're just selling them because you want to make money off of them try to put yourself in their shoes show them something that'll benefit them that's what you want to do so for Voice AI agents you know Voice as a whole we keep our pitches simple we show them demos we get them on a call with us we just showcase like this is what we can do for you and this is how it can help your business it can catch calls that you're missing after hours like how many calls are you missing after hours just a lot of times a lot of business oh yeah you know I think we had one client that was missing 60% of their calls wow when they actually tracked it before hours after hours during the day 60% like what if we were to catch 55 you know 55% of that 60% yeah and convert those 55% there into something meaningful say we convert 50% of them into something a meaningful action they booked an appointment with you or they got the answer they needed so now imagine what that extra 25 to 30% in that business would do for them yep that will significantly increase revenues a lot of times people just don't realize how much they're actually missing how many calls they miss yep and if you're listening to this and you need a couple stats you can throw out you know you can lie you know 82% of statistics are made up but these are uh produced by people actually did studies on this 62% of B calls to small businesses go unanswered and $187,500 is the average amount that a small business loses per year to missed calls and those are two studies that you can pull out use in your marketing push out there and um you know if they ask you where you got it you just I'll I'll try to link it somewhere but um this is a real it's and you're getting as close to the sale as possible you're just helping all of their interested people not have a bad experience with that business i have one example that not for enterprise but just convenient solution that one client they're brand new to voice AI brand new it's like oh how do I sell it who's gonna want it literally every single business that has a receptionist or has to do appointment booking just start with as your use case simple so he's like "Okay." Then he called me back the next day he's like "Oh my god check this out i went to a salon my salon friend um she runs a salon she has a receptionist who wanted a raise and all she was doing was answering the calls and booking an appointment that's all she was doing i think it was like 22 bucks an hour she wanted more she wanted she was at 20 she wanted 22 she's like "I can't afford this." Like her job is literally just answer and book an appointment like it's so trivial then the salon owner said "I can't afford this." I said "Okay I quit." She left so now she doesn't have someone answering the calls anymore it was just convenient timing this client one of our friends says "Hey I got a solution for you that might help you out you want to check it out i have an agent that can answer all your phone calls and it can send your clients a booking link because they're using their own proprietary software anyway so it's perfect so we'll just send them a booking link and it'll handle your bookings for you and or it can take a message." She's like "Okay let me try it out how much will it cost?" He's like "I just made up a number on the spot." $6.97 a month right i'm like "Okay." And what she say she go "That's amazing that's awesome." Because in her mind she's comparing it against paying $2,000 or $2,200 for the payroll taxes and all that stuff so she in her mind she's saving $1,500 in his mind with his whole unlimited plan he's making $500 $600 a month yeah and very simple use case hey thanks for calling SA Salon unable to take your call how can I help you today whatever you want to book an appointment promise send you a message oh you want to learn more about our different pricing here's the pricing options very simple he closed a client and you know I don't I haven't heard what happened after that but it's she was ecstatic with it because it saved her tons of money it was a simple sale it was very simple and going back to what you said about getting in the rooms with these people and just giving them basically a test drive like "Hey I have this demo what do you think?" I I when you pull me out of my normal everyday life I go to the high level summit whatever somebody random walks up to me and asks me for some advice or ask says like "Oh I saw your YouTube videos i had a question on X Y and Z." I'm so down to chat and I love it because I can tell they're a normal person i'm not getting weird vibes whatever but if you DM me hey can you help me with this i'm like no I get 20 DMs a day so it's the same thing and um so yeah head to the like there's some very very high level entrepreneurs that walk around at everyday conferences in your city or close to your city or whatever it is and uh I love that advice just like get out of your house and start chatting to people and it doesn't even like I've been doing doortodoor it's pretty nerve-wracking it's tough i'm working on some franchises right now it's not going great um but uh you know I'm continuing to try but going to a conference where the everybody's guard is kind of down because everyone's pitching a little bit and just like starting to chat and bringing up what you do like that anti-sales approach is is so effective and it's even as a beginner like you're in a great spot if you just get in the room with this person who's doing $100 million a year you can probably uh pitch him and say we're built on the best you know enterprise grade software in the world do you want to try it out so back to one of your points you made a lot of times people have the conception or misconception the high level is really meant for small businesses or medium agency size you know 50 clients that's good if you really want something real deal you go to like a sales force or you go to that larger enterprise clients that's we're we are really redefining that now whereas we're really building our whole infrastructure on top of high level the voice the automations all the APIs there's so much we're able to do by wrapping around high level we focus on the sales engine the front end side and let high level do the heavy automation the AI the engine let high level be that marketing operating system as you know we all know it to be and we can wrap around our business intelligence around it so we're on our side we're able to build these crazy analytics all on top of high level we built our own reporting dashboard for our clients how many calls how much money are you saving or how many calls did you miss so we have our own analytics that we build all leveraging high levels APIs pulling all the data in and we build our own dashboard because these are type of things that enterprise clients want as well enterprise clients need reporting no matter what the tool is great but if they have the reporting you can't justify your value without the reporting and there's small versions of that that you can do in high level sending some weekly reporting spin up a a dashboard of your own on lovable or similar nowadays um that that's super cool though and it's you know anyone listening that is maybe another Scipio out in the world and thinking about doing this like you have the resources you can go crush it um just use my affiliate link not first definitely mine um okay so I want to give like maybe you haven't actually done this uh method or something else but you are with these enterprise grade clients every day you work on the rollouts you see what they need just give me another I know you said go to events you know all of that is amazing but give me another thing like if you were starting from scratch and you wanted to close a really big client what else would you try to try to get in the room with these guys first I would build a proper demo on my side so have a proper landing page showcase a pre-recorded demo of different niches that you're going after show them because a lot of times you know if I get a link I may click on it i'll go to the website hey that's pretty cool i may want to check it out on my own so have a landing page a lot of times people on pitch oh let's get on a call i'm not getting on a call with you i don't I don't know who you are it's like you know before I used to be the same way hey let's get on a call let's get on a call it's like I get DMs all the time saying "Hey can we jump on a call?" I'm like "I don't know who you are i don't know if my time is going to be well spent can you please tell me why we're going to hop on a call?" Yeah so now it's like "Hey I want to show you something pretty cool check this site out uh I have a bunch of demos i think it'll be helpful for you so curate the messaging for me don't hop on a call as being the first time I need to hear the message or I'm not going to get on the call yeah do the work for me it's like back in the day I remember I needed a reference letter from someone two weeks later I still didn't get it he's like can he's he said "Can you just write up the reference letter and send it to me and I'll sign it?" I'm like "Done." As soon as I wrote it up sent it over to him signed it sent it back so I got it done in two minutes after waiting two weeks for them to send it to me do the work so in this case here I have the landing page ready to go have examples ready to go have some basic stats or use cases or draw some parallels for them because when people are skimming it they want to know how is it going to help them out so then you can get into Facebook groups in different industries as well just show people yeah you know I'm having success using this don't do a hard pitch just give advice showcase what you can do people will then click on your link go to your profile they'll check you out and if you're genuine about your advice it's a simple way of generating leads you get a few here and there and and growth you get one or two that love you they go that's fantastic and if they're already in that niche they're going to refer you to other people as well so you're one to two degrees of separation away from some of the most powerful CEOs in the world like someone you know knows someone that went to high school with them and they still chat you know like don't discount someone as a if you can add value to the person he could become your case study he could become your you know your beach head client for yourself hey check this guy out you have any questions look what he did for his business and if you're able to add value to him he as you said you never know who has contact sometimes you'll be very surprised like wow this person knows this person it's impressive and they can get you the foot they can get your foot in the door in an enterprise uh client as well they might have a system that works at this massive company and that person will get you in so cold emailing you know people do it still i don't ever check my cold emails that's just me but I guess that's a lot of people as well but it works obviously people keep doing it so it does work but if you're selling a very specific type of product find have a strategy in place that does work showcase it show your expertise become known for that product itself and people and start dominating your industry in that space and if if you think we're bullshitting right now I I genuinely got on a call with the CMO of a big franchise here in Utah by posting a Facebook group so haven't closed them yet but I will make a video on it if I close them um but yeah it was I I had no idea who he was he he was like "Yeah I want to check it out." and uh he was actually getting on for a different purpose another business but he is the CMO of a multilocation franchise and I said "Hey would this make sense?" He's like "Yeah I have to figure out like which channels to send this through." So it's a slower sales process but if we get that closed you're not just getting one one client for 200 to 800 a month you're getting 15 or you know 30 100 best case scenario um so the main value that I think you can provide besides what we've already gone through for is this like engineering process of how do you actually identify what needs to be built and build it in a way that doesn't suck and doesn't make your life like this constant putting out fires so I'd love to hear your process for that i think you mentioned four like base bots that you kind of say "Hey Gabe which one do you want?" And then from there you customize it for the person and and um and then tell us what you will and won't customize and why for people yeah so if you're going to scale this you need to have a process in place customizing every agent is fun at the beginning because you feel like "Oh I'm building cool stuff but becomes very painful to maintain." So if you want to go to market yeah if you go to market and you want to pitch something build specific templates or agents as you want to say so for example you know after their their office hours are down so after hour agent have an agent that will be ready to go for after hours then you can create some variations of that so after hours it'll just be hey I'll take a message for you i'll answer questions and we can take a message or if someone want after hours they want to take an appointment we can also send you an appointment link so that's we we refer to as two different agents an after hours agent without a link or one with link so that's how we differentiate it we need to know when we're onboarding the client do you have a appointment booking link that you want to share yes or no or do you have a scheduling page or a website you want to send people to so depending on how many additional things they want because for every additional thing we need to handle it differently in the prompting we need to we need to create new actions for it to handle it as well and we need to make sure that they all work closely together so you'll have different agent templates you put together you give the depending on the client you're going after you give them the option do you want a agent that does this and give a summary what it does do you want an agent that does that or you know the other you give them the options only those options because when he said no you know I want something that does all that like just let's start with one of these let's just start with one of these because it's easy to build on something you already have when it's rolling then you'll invest time and energy on it for them because now they're committed as well the worst is building a brand new agent rolling out customizing it for them then they don't even use it like ah you know change my mind you put all this energy and effort up thinking it's going to be a longer play so now we just say just choose one of these and it does it handles 95% of what everyone needs in general very specific it fulfills this use case part of doing the work for them right it's part of not not being like what do you want and then they come back with this like crazy list it's part of I mean it keeps your life simpler but it's also better for the client because they don't the confused mind always says no yeah we had one client where we offered to build out the agent for them and that has been taking four weeks now back and forth we deploy like oh we have more feedback so it's take and these things like you're not making money anymore so you template the process make sure it's working well you have all the workflows in place ready to go you build your snapshot you have everything organized so from beginning to end you have a the sales process once you sell them these are different agents got it then once that's approved the handoff to the team that's building it out okay we want this agent check what do you want to call your agent so these are part of your intake form process we'll have very specific questions like what are your office hours what do you want to name your agent what type of voice would you like what are the services you offer who are the main people whatever is relevant for their business based on the industry that you're focusing on like what payment methods do you accept do you accept insurance so depends on the industry so we'll have a check you know if you're in the paramedical space you have a very specific list of type of questions you want them fill in so you already have your agent template ready to go you go and fill in all those templates if you want to even more automate it you pass that through an API i'll push the custom values i'll update your snapshot so you can even really automate it at the beginning keep it simple so now you deploy your agent then you'll pass it back to the client so to get their first round of so obviously you build the agent have someone on your team QA it as well you have an SOP process to make sure that are your workflows enabled is the phone number enabled do you have your recording on are the transcripts being sent out did you name it correctly your custom values everything filled in so you have a checklist you go through SLP and if you don't have a what you know what type of questions to ask QA take your AI agent put into chat G TBT saying I need some QA questions to ask this agent really not hard right imagine that so it'll come up okay saying are you open are you closed what are your hours it'll give you a list of 20 questions to ask and you go through it check then we hand then the sales team then will follow up with the client saying your agent's ready to go uh can you review it and give us your feedback so we give them feedback back for so we ask them how confident they feel based on how the agent is right now to go live with it so we'll have people give us you know 10 on 10 others will say "Oh I'm at seven right now." Okay why are you at a seven oh when I asked this question it didn't know the answer to it or when I asked this question it didn't have that answer like okay great so what is the answer to that question you know sometimes in the intake form it's very something very specific and we won't know the answer to these questions not our industry so yeah we'll ask them okay great no problem give us the FAQs that we should be training our agent on give us this FAQs or tell us where to get it if it's on your website we'll pull it from your website if it's here tell us where it is we'll extract all that data we'll put it into the FAQs then we'll run through the simulation again ourselves okay let's QA the process make sure it's answering all these questions handling all these edge cases get ready to go then we'll send it back to the operations team to push the client again to give us another round of feedback and if they're happy with it we roll it out we go live there's a whole process for that and then we're not done then we'll also be reviewing their transcripts every day we'll spot check them to make sure that we want to catch issues before the client complains about an issue so every sing okay okay let's check this one check that one check that one so we have a you know VAS on our side they'll review them and they'll extract feedback we have a tracking sheet okay this is this is what should have happened but this is what happened instead so we'll track it and based on that if it's things that it just it didn't have the knowledge for then we'll go find how we should get that knowledge or if it's something that we should have handled but somehow it didn't cover it we'll fix it and then we'll update it so we refine it for the first 30 days and then then we'll do spot checks after the fact or we wait on client feedback that's why when people are building out the agent they charge all I'm going to charge 297 you're going to get burnt charging 297 because then the client's going to say "Hey I want to fix this." You're like "Ah really?" Yeah like I don't I can't invest that more time on this it's like you get a client you underpric it and then they want more work it's like they already paid you for it so you're you feel obliged to fix it but at the same time they're not paying you enough that you feel excited to fix it so then you provide a bad experience for them then they cancel and turn out then you complain about all this time you wasted on them but it's just you're setting yourself up for failure so make sure you when you factor in this pricing whatever you're going to charge charge a setup fee there is a setup process part of your setup process is build the roll out the maintenance for the first 30 to 60 days and then you have monthly uh recurring charges for the AI costs for the AI agent itself as service and once you have all that in place then you can you already have your foot in the door it's working then you can upsell other services at the same time yes but get the first one right get that first one right make them happy guys caveat to all this just sell your first one and you know you can sell the first one for 297 i don't care like whatever but then switch to value based pricing once you understand what you're doing here value based pricing is this isn't cost plus this isn't oh this is what it cost me so I'm going to add a little bit of margin on it it's like this is actually what it's worth to you because the alternative is having a human or a caller answering service or something else and the value to you in the terms of the revenue that you're going to make on capturing a good amount of that and you know 10 5K 10K 20K 50K builds are not unheard of because of if you know if it's a roofer and they're going to make you know 10,000 to $20,000 of profit on every single deal that they do like yeah they're going to pay you 10 grand to get to set it up we have an e-commerce platform we're working with right now as well and that one requires API calls hitting the Shopify store so some someone calls in saying "Hey I want to check the status of my order." So this is kind of just letting people know how you can push the limits here so someone calls in thanks for calling um how can I help you today it's like oh yeah I want to check the status of my order no problem what's your order ID they give you order ID then we'll call a custom action that will call the API it'll send the order ID and it's going to return back the tracking number and the date it was ordered or shipped and the shipping method then we'll take all that information and say "Would you like us to send you a text with your tracking information?" Yeah then we'll text them back the tracking information that's all done through HighLE and a little bit of API work on the back end but it's all baked in within the solution so we're using High Leo's custom action for the API call and we're using workflows for the messaging it all works well you got to head out here for her thanks so much for coming on is there any last piece of advice you'd leave for somebody listening here i I see this comment a lot you know AI this is the worst it's ever going to be so on high level right now last year it was okay this year it's getting pretty awesome i've seen the road map i know where it's going in the next 2 3 months it's going to be incredible in the next few months because the few you know a lot of the feedback that I've been giving while I was there and even now giving the feedback how to improve certain things they're taking all that and it's just it's now they have that inertia it's building up the team's growing so everything that we need to do to improve it is getting better and better so anyone who's not or who's been hesitating oh should I sell voice AI should I not i'm not sure about high level i'm going to use this third party there's no reason to use a third party anymore pretty you can use it if you want to build more custom buildouts no doubt so just to add that disclaimer if you want to do something very grass they want to build a whole comedy AI agent or they wanted a fortune teller agent or they want an accounting agent i'm like don't use high level for that that's not for that's not that's not within High Level's wheelhouse go use your own custom AI then you can train it customize it curate the way you need it high level's core goal is it's very use case goal focused let's book an appointment let's answer your questions let's do it's very precise what needs to get done that is what covers the 80 to 90% of what the use cases of people need you want your own custom builds go to a third party don't And by the way that's all you want to sell at the beginning like you're just going to make your life miserable trying to do really custom stuff if this is the first thing you sold so focus on a very narrow use case and deliver with the best tech available for that yeah and just get started get started start working on it it's really not hard to learn like going from zero to 80 will take you like two or 3 weeks then that last 20% that's just trial and error trial and error trial and error so true and the big thing I got from you today Fer is like this there's a wave of people who are firing receptionists trying to figure out like solo practitioners who are like do I hire a VA do I hire a receptionist or do I just do AI and I I had a call with one recently and I was like "Look even if you don't do the AI now you're gonna end up doing it in two months so you may as well just do it now." Um it's it's good enough and it's just getting better yeah perfect love it man thanks so much if if someone wants to work with fur uh whether you're a big enterprise client I just referred one to him um or if you are just starting out with high level we'll have the links below to get in contact with him or join his community awesome sweet man thanks so much take care
