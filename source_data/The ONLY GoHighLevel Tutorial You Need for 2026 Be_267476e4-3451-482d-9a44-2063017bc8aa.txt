just getting started on GoHigh Level in 2026 Now of course I've made tons of videos in the past for 2025 2024 2023 and even 2022 on this topic But go High Level and SAS is constantly adapting constantly changing So I have to update these videos every single year So this is the one for 2026 If you're a beginner or even if you're not a beginner this video is going to break down everything

difference between agency mode and sub account mode So if you watch this video all the way through you're not only going to know that but you're going to know so much about Goi Level and exactly what you need to do when you get started So of course the first thing that you need to do when you start with GHL is sign up for GoH High Leo Now most of you watching need to be using an affiliate because

and I promise you will not be disappointed But either way let's get into the video What should you do when you get started on GoHigh Level in 2026 All right guys So once you're logged into the platform the first thing that you might want to do is come up with some of your plans And when I say that I mean your essential plan professional plan or premium plan because most of you watching are probably on the agency side or the SAS agency side and you're trying to sell sub accounts Now if you're on the 497 SAS plan then you're going to see the SAS configurator right here I'm not going to fully break this down because I just did it in a recent video and a lot of you watching are not on this plan so I know this doesn't affect you but basically this is where you customize your plans This is where you change your pricing And this is where you can add multiple plans if they do not appear right here And don't worry if you do not have the 497 plan You can still do this Of course you can still have your own plans You just have to do it manually I'll show you guys how to do that in a second But for right now this is the SAS configurator If you're on the 497 go watch my onboarding video I show you exactly how to do this or just be my affiliate and I give you the snapshots and the courses and everything for it But there you go That is the SAS configurator for the 497 plan Next I'm going to come down here to sub accounts Now sub accounts is extremely important guys because this is how you control all of the sub accounts including your own sub account which houses your website your conversation tab how you talk to people Literally you cannot run an agency without having a sub account for yourself And when you start and go high level the first thing they have you do is create a sub account It literally does it automatically So you should see your sub account right here at the top And if you're on the 97 or 297 plan and you're ready to create another sub account for a client or a test account then you would come right up here to create sub account And you have all these different options up here If you're on the 497 plan you'll see SAS account at the top If you're not you're only going to see regular Most of you watching are just going to do a blank snapshot unless you have a snapshot ready to go If you're an affiliate of mine I give you tons of snapshots for all different categories all different business industries or you can even use GoHigh Level Standard ones right here Automotive legal beauty fashion travel hospitality They're okay They're not perfect by any means but they are okay Personally I think everyone should just start with a blank snapshot and continue Then you have a few different options right here where you can actually search for the business is on Google or you can just click add manually which is what I do and most people do And then you just fill in all this information right here and you're good to go Very easy to do You can do this with anyone and everyone You can do this with your own account You can do this with a test account that doesn't even exist But this is how you add a sub account so that you can build everything that we're about to do in the next 20 30 minutes Now I'm going to move on to account snapshots Now for anyone watching who has no idea what a snapshot is you've probably heard the term multiple times especially on YouTube Whenever you hear the word snapshot just think of a glorified copy and paste Basically anything that you can build inside of GoHigh Level can be copied and sent over to your account That means if I build some amazing website and amazing automations and some crazy AI chatbot I can literally copy it turn it into a snapshot and then send it to you It doesn't cost any money at all This is completely free to do Another really good use of a snapshot where you can create your own is if you niche down in your agency Let's say you only go after gyms and your agency specifically targets gym memberships and people that own gyms Then you can actually create that perfect gym sub account All the automations the websites the funnel pages all the marketing everything that you need to make a perfect snapshot And then you can create it right here for one sub account and give it to all the other sub accounts So instead of having to set someone up and onboard them every single time you just give them the snapshot This literally speeds up the process so much when onboarding clients And although you might not use it a lot in the beginning you will definitely use these later in life So there you go That is snapshots All this other stuff up here we're going to skip It's not that important You don't need to know it especially when you're starting out The reselling section is usually for SAS pro people So it's more so for the 497 plan guys And then everything else is kind of GHL upsells So we're going to scroll all the way down here to the settings where the first tab is your profile So this is your personal profile how you log in how you change your password how you change your name and even the email in which you log in as well Don't worry I'm going to show you another way to change all this stuff but for right now I have so many people that sign in with a certain email they want to change it later This is how you do it Next on the list is company Now your company should be your agency So this is going to be all of your agency information This is how you find your relationship number You need this whenever you deal with support which is up here at the top right Click on this question mark icon You can start a chat right here or raise a ticket and they're going to ask you your relationship number which is also right here So if you couldn't find it there it is Over to the right we have white label So if you're white labeling it you're going to put your logo right here As you can see this is not my logo I just wanted to blend into the top because I personally make a lot of white labelled videos for my affiliates for my students and I do not want my logo up here when I'm filming those So that's kind of why I did that right there But this section is very important when you're white labeling the entire software itself As you can see at the top in this URL it does not say app.go It says app.io systems which is my LLC It's my name And the only way to do that and to hide the gohighle name is to enter all that information in the white label domain If you need any help with the setup you can click the question mark icon right here And they give you video instructions This is actually super easy to do I have so many videos on this So once again not going to break down how to do it but it's just something that you should do when you get started We also have privacy policies and terms and conditions This is very important All my affiliates get done for you privacy policies that you guys can use so you don't have to go create your own All right Next on the list go to team This is very very important because this is going to be how you see and enter your entire team And when I say team I mean literally anyone who is under your account That means clients that means employees that means you Every single user that can access this account is all right here And then you can click add user right here And you can add in any user that you want So let's say you have a virtual assistant or an employee You're going to add them right here And then you can click on roles and permissions and you can give them access or take away access to anything that you want right here This is a very important section that you guys need to learn Play around with this section for a little bit Learn how to add people Learn how to take people off certain accounts Move them to different sub accounts which you do by clicking this button right here and choosing the sub accounts that you want them under And then of course the user type agency or account If you want them to see your entire agency and every account underneath it But if they're a client they just have one little sub account then they're of course going to go under account So there you go That is the team section very important Definitely go through it Next of course we have the billing section This is where you see the plan that you're on I'm currently on the 497 plan of course cuz it's the best This is where you can modify or cancel your subscription or downgrade You can do that right here And then of course you can go over to payments wallets and transactions and notifications to see everything about your billing information I'm not going to click on that cuz I got a lot of personal info in there but it's pretty self-explanatory Next on the list is phone integrations This is where you can switch all of your phone integrations from Twilio if you signed up with Twilio and you can migrate all of them over to LC phone which means lead connector phone number So lead connector is basically go highle's version of Twilio And if you're brand new to GHL and you have no idea what I'm saying that's totally fine Just think of Twilio or lead connector as the base of how you're going to be sending out text messages and phone calls for your entire agency and all of the sub accounts So it is extremely important that you understand this I personally would keep everything on LC phone It's just a lot easier You don't have to sign up for Twilio pay extra money And I'll be honest guys it's the exact same thing LC phone is literally backed by Twilio It's the same thing So just make sure LC phone is enabled for the sub account that you want And then I'll show you what to do when we get to that part next Once that's done we've got email services right here Kind of like the exact same thing You can just use lead connector email system Go over to location settings right here and click on which ones you want to use for LC email I must point out we are still in the agency section Now they're going to have sections in the settings for the sub accounts for phone integrations and email services as well but that is more specific to the account This is for everything every single client that you have So when you're in the agency section just remember that it's an overall view of everything When you're in the sub account it is specific to that client but we will get there in a second We don't need to go over all this other stuff It's a little more advanced You definitely don't need to do it when you're just getting started So I'm going to come all the way down here to Stripe And this is just where you can connect your Stripe integration I recommend everyone on here use Stripe especially if you're on the 497 plan One of the first things that you should do is connect Stripe That's how you're going to do all of your payment processing for your agency And it's just a lot easier than PayPal or NMI or any of these other options So if you're in the United States or if you're in a country that allows Stripe I definitely recommend using Stripe You don't have to use it but it's pretty easy And that is pretty much it for the agency side Once you have all of that figured out and set up the agency side of things is good to go Now it's just about understanding the sub account side which is where you're going to spend 90% of your time So let's go up here and click here to switch And I'm going to go to my serial systems account So this is what the sub account looks like This is like I said where you're going to spend almost all of your time This is how you build the websites This is how you build automations This is how you text message people It is all going to be done inside of the sub account view And your first sub account should be your company It should be your agency My serial systems agency is literally my first sub account ever And the first thing that I did was I went to the Launchpad And don't worry your Launchpad might look a little bit different than this one but they're all the exact same thing Basically the Launchpad is just trying to get you to integrate and do everything I'm telling you to do on this video So the first thing you're going to want to do is download the mobile app that is called Lee Connector You can just physically go do this if you want on the App Store or on the Google Play Store if you have Samsung or an Android And once you download the app it is going to be the exact same login information that you used when you created the account But if you forget that rewind this video go back to settings go back to profile and change your password if you forgot it already Once you're logged into the app that's where you're going to be messaging people back and forth It's just really easy convenient and you definitely want to learn the mobile app Once again if you're my affiliate I go over all of that I have videos showing exactly how to use the mobile app I even have white label videos on the mobile app itself which means you can take my own videos they're completely white labeled and send them to your clients So your clients can just watch me break down the entire tutorial of the app Because most clients when you get a client on GHL are only going to be using the mobile app They're not necessarily going to come in and see this entire view right here Because when you onboard a client correctly they don't need to mess with all this other stuff They're just going to be answering questions and responding to people in the mobile app But don't worry I break that all down in the course as well By the way my course is completely free I just have other courses and snapshots that you get when you're my affiliate But if you want a nice free course description below go check it out Next on the list is the Google profile This is the Google My Business profile Now you do not have to have a Google My Business profile for your agency It just helps a little bit especially if you're a local agency Like for instance for a long time my agency was ran in Springfield Illinois So I created a Google My Business account for that agency so that people in Springfield could find me It's not the most important thing in the world to do for an agency but it is definitely something that you should learn how to do for your clients Your clients should definitely have this If they're a barber shop or a landscaper maybe they're a plumber or a lawyer they have to have a GMBB account There is no getting around this they have to have it and they have to connect it right here because there's so many amazing things that you can do when your GMBB account is connected to GHL We're going to cover it but it's pretty crazy Next on the list is Facebook Sadly I'm no longer on Facebook hence why it's not connected But if you're watching this and you have a Facebook account you can connect it right here And in a second I'll go over everything that can happen when you connect your Facebook account Next is your web chat We're not going to do anything with this because you can do it all in the sites tab I'm going to show you guys how to do that So I don't recommend clicking connect for the chat widget It's kind of just a waste of time Integrate WhatsApp If you guys use WhatsApp most of you watching will not be using WhatsApp And then of course Stripe you're going to want to integrate it again on the sub account view I know that sounds confusing but it is not confusing at all You need to integrate this twice One on your agency side and one on your sub account And once again I break it down in my course but basically when you're creating products and payments you do that in the sub account view So that is why it needs to be connected here Next on the list is listings We're going to skip that one You guys do not need to know about it right now Next on the list is WordPress So unless your company is using WordPress your agency uses WordPress I would probably skip this as well I would just use GHL to create the websites I think they host just fine But if you're a big WordPress person you can connect it right here and run everything through Go High Level And then lastly we have quickly add team members So if you have multiple team members that you want inside of a specific sub account not the agency the sub account you would add that right here So there you go That is the main integrations inside of GHL on the Launchpad We have a few more integrations to talk about in a second but for right now we're going to go over to the dashboard Now the dashboard is something that some businesses use and some businesses do not I personally for the first three years on go high level did not use the dashboard at all And then as my landscaping and land clearing business started to grow I started to use the dashboard Basically when you hear the word dashboard just think all of your opportunities and your pipelines all of the money coming in and the customers coming in being tracked on this dashboard So you can just see everything You can just see all your charts all the data that you need for that company There are a lot of clients that might want this I personally have had clients that love it but me personally I kind of keep track of everything in QuickBooks so I'm not too worried about the dashboard But for my landscaping and land clearing company it comes in handy very well So that's the dashboard It's all connected to opportunities and pipelines which we're going to get to in a second And I've got some amazing videos on YouTube that break down exactly how to set all that stuff up And I have snapshots that are already completed that will give you opportunities and pipelines customized for your liking But you only get that if you're an affiliate So sign up link in the description below You already know Next on the list is conversations tab Now this is insanely important The conversations tab is where you literally talk to anyone and everyone for your agency As you can see down here it's not only SMS but it's also WhatsApp email iMessage If you connect Facebook your Facebook could be right here Instagram DMs could be right here It's literally how you talk with anyone through your agency It's also exactly how your clients talk to their customers So this is super super important You need to understand it And it all circles back to that Twilio lead connector we were talking about earlier the phone integration Because once you connect the phone system get a phone number life becomes so much easier because this connects to everything All of your social media your automation your website your chat widget all of it connects into the conversations tab All right guys Next on the list is the calendars tab Now a lot of the clients are going to want to connect their calendars And you're going to hear this quite often They're going to say "Well I already have a calendar I have an Outlook calendar a Google calendar I don't want to lose it." Don't worry they don't have to lose it You can integrate all of those calendars Just click on calendar setting right here Click on connections and there it is You've got your Google calendar You can connect I can click on add linked calendar And as you can see you've got iCloud You've got and as you can see over here you can connect Outlook iCloud all of these different calendars you can connect and even come over here to video conferencing And you can connect Zoom and Google Meet So don't worry about the connections and integrations They're all right here guys Super easy to do Or you can just create your own calendars from scratch which is what I do of course So I can click on new calendar right here I've got all these different options I can even explore more options I've got personal one-on-one bookings I've got roundroin collective bookings class bookings If you have like a class event calendars and service booking If you have service calendars that means let's say you have four or five services landscaping land clearing snow removal etc etc you can actually add the service here and someone can book one service while another person books a different service Super easy to do I have a calendar video coming out or it might have come out before this video I'm not sure yet but I break down exactly how to build a service booking calendar because I believe this is going to be one of the more important calendars that you create for your clients So definitely check out that video or wait for that video depending on when this one comes out All right guys next on the list is contacts This is where you add all of the contacts that you already have or this is where you build up your contact list which is another thing that GHL does very well is trying to build up a client's contact list so they can send out emails text messages automations whatever it may be You can do that all up here in a mass text mass email way So let's say I wanted to send out an email to every single person I've got over 71,000 records on here That means 71,000 contacts I can click on this box right here and then click on select all 71,000 and I can send out a text or an email to every single one Now of course this has to fall into the privacy policy and the regulations with A2P I'm going to break that down in a second I know it sounds confusing but if you watch my videos watch my tutorials I promise it's not that bad But as long as you're fully compliant then yes you can send out texts and emails to all of these different people Now most of you watching are not going to have 71,000 people in your list I've been building this list for 4 years That's why it's so big But when you're signing up clients a lot of them already have lists It might be 200 it might be 200,000 but they have lists And you can click on this import contact button and you can import that list right in GHL and it's going to save you so much time and make the account work so much better So definitely do that when you're getting started Always ask your clients do you have a contact list and if not we'll help you build one All right guys Next on the list is opportunities I just brought this up earlier Opportunities and pipelines might sound a little confusing at first but I promise they're not that bad And once you learn how to do them you can create systems for anyone and everyone that you can think of So when you hear the word opportunity or the word pipeline just think of creating a system And the system is built in stages So of course right out the gate this is just a random one but the first stage is a lead So when a lead comes in the second stage is customer So how does one become a customer the next stage is conversations And then the last stage is conversion So converting someone into a customer This is actually not a very good example but it's just the one that was on here Let me click on pipeline so I can show you what it's supposed to look like I'm going to click on create pipeline And this is where you create the actual stage names So let me give you a quick example Let's say the first stage is Facebook lead So for this example let's say that I'm running a Facebook ad for a landscaping company And the first stage is going to be when we get a Facebook lead from that ad The next stage is going to be a response So I could say customer responded or I could put response right here I'll say customer responded The next one I'm actually going to keep as proposal sent So let's say the customer responded about landscaping and then we were able to send them a proposal or a bid for how much that job is going to be And then of course the last one is going to be closed We were able to close it Now this one's very simple It's only four stages long You can make these 10 stages long 20 stages long I recommend keeping them at four to six stages You don't want everything to get too confusing but you can automate this entire process Businesses will love you for doing so and they will pay you every single month to do so Don't worry Like I said I have videos going over all this specifically I don't have time to go over every single thing that we're talking about or this video would literally be 10 hours long I'm just trying to get you guys set up show you guys exactly what you're getting inside of GHL and give you a quick summary of what you should do what you should learn and how you can sell it or use it for your own company So there you go That's pipeline and opportunities Let's move on Next on the list is the payment section Now this part is pretty interesting pretty fun There's a lot going into this When I first got into GoHigh Lee back in 2022 actually I think I got in back in 2021 I might be wrong about that I'll have to go back and look at when I signed up But my point is when I first signed up they didn't have any of this They did not have invoices estimates documents contracts orders subscriptions payment links They had none of this guys So this is a really big deal that you have so many options so many things that you can sell so many things that you can use for your own company You can create your own invoices recurring invoices create templates so you can just use those all the time Create documents and contracts templates for those orders subscriptions payment links transactions products create your own products You can have coupons for any of those products And then of course we have the integration section at the back where you can integrate Stripe or integrate any of these payment processors Check this out Look how many different options we have Square Easy Pay Direct WOP API Pay Tabs Global with whatever language that is Madison Payment Specialist more different languages I mean the list goes on and on and on I can assure you you will find some type of payment processor in here that fits your needs I'm still scrolling It's just ridiculous how many options you guys have But for me I'm going to be sticking with Stripe I use PayPal every once in a while but Stripe's the best They even have gift cards This is actually brand new I've not seen this yet but it gives me another YouTube video to make So I'm going to make a video on gift cards cuz I'm just now seeing this I did not know this existed Super cool I'm going to play around with this and then I'm going to make a video on it for you guys because that's what I do I find out new stuff about GHL I make videos I master it I figure it out And then I tell you guys exactly how to use it what to do how to sell it and everything in between So I'm excited I'll do that right after this video But I'm already thinking of so many different ways that you can use gift cards for an agency use them for your own clients or your own business Really cool stuff But let's get out of it All right guys Next on the list is AI agents Now I could go on forever about AI agents but I'm not going to I don't want to go down this rabbit hole right now in this video mostly because I've talked about AI agents so many times on my channel And if you sign up with my affiliate link you get a ton of free AI bots that are already built specifically to you and specifically for certain industries So definitely check that out But the AI agents are insanely advanced They keep getting better and better over time The last video that I just did showed full in-depth on how to use conversation AI and voice AI how to train them how to use them correctly This is going to be a massive selling point because if you're watching this and you know nothing about AI you can run an AI agency It doesn't really take a lot of work It doesn't take a lot of knowledge when AI is doing most of the work for you anyway So you can actually create your own conversation AI bot It can be specific to whatever client that you're signing up So for example let's say it's a lawn care client The AI conversation bot can study everything about that lawn care client everything about that business and it will now know it forever and can answer it inside of a chatbot 24 hours a day This is the future This is what's going to happen This is going to take over the business world And if you're not up to date with it if you don't figure it out as an agency now then you're definitely going to get left behind in the next couple years So definitely check this out Learn conversation AI learn voice AI learn how to set it up learn how to sell it correctly and I promise you can get 20 30 100 200 clients and be very very happy with that residual income coming in every single month while conversation AI and Voice AI do all the heavy lifting for you But once again all of it's in the courses guys It's all free It's just about if you take action or not and you start learning this stuff ASAP So definitely check out AI agents It's going to be one of your main selling points when you get into GHL I just don't want to break it down right now in this video It'll take hours and I've already done it so many times on my channel already All right guys Next is marketing So under the marketing tab we've got social planner This is where you can actually connect all of your social medias for your client or for yourself Connect your Facebook Instagram Google My Business LinkedIn yada yada yada Literally everything you can connect it anytime there's a DM or anytime you want to do a post you can just do it right inside of GHL Super cool Not my favorite feature by any means It's not life-changing by any means either but it's just another feature that you can use especially when you first get started Next on the list is emails So if you're doing any type of email templates you can just create the campaigns and the templates right over here Click on templates You can create them with AI but I just did a video on this And I'm going to be honest with you guys because I'm very honest when it comes to go high level I did not like the AI email builder I didn't think it was good It's not up todate and it is definitely not ready So I wouldn't use this feature I would just go to new and I would click on email marketing templates and I would choose one that's already done So as you can see you've got a ton of different options here and you can even search for a templates Look for auto and there you go We got a bunch of car ones right here Choose it edit it and you're good to go That is how you create email templates inside of GHL Next on the list we've got snippets So this is kind of the same thing where you can actually create your own snippet Think of it like a template as well If I click on plus new snippet I'm going to do a text message one And I can actually type in a message that let's say I type in all the time Maybe a customer asks the same question all the time This happens in business every single day So you can actually type the answer that you keep having to type every day And then once you type that in and enter the snippet name you're good to go You can even add attachments Maybe there's a photo or a digital business card that you want to send I'll even give you an example Let's say it's an introduction So there we go We've got introduction message here I can type in hey and then I can click on this little custom value tag I can go to contact and I can actually put their first name So it automatically puts their first name in Whoever I'm messaging it puts their first name in right here This is Dominic Baptist and I just wanted to introduce myself and send you my card So I typed all that in for the snippet I can then add the attachment right here Let's say I had a virtual digital business card or something like that I can add the attachment and it will automatically save and send to anybody that I want It's not life-changing by any means but it's just something that I use quite often because I don't want to type the same thing over and over again For instance when I have to send someone my course I have a snippet with a course link right in here So it saves me a lot of time saves me a lot of effort I do this for real estate agents a lot too cuz they have to constantly introduce themselves of who they are So if you're a business person and you're watching this I promise you'll find some use in this But either way let's get out of it All this other stuff is not super important if you're just getting started out Affiliate manager is kind of cool but once again a little bit more advanced If you want to create your own affiliate program for a client or for yourself you can actually do so in the affiliate manager section I've made videos on this in the past I can do it in the future if you want but once again a little too advanced for someone who is just getting started in 2026 And the last thing that I want to do is overwhelm anybody watching this I know that there's so much going into GHL but I promise you it's not that hard guys You can go through all the basics You'll be fine All right guys Next on the list is automation Now this is probably one of the most important things you're ever going to learn inside of GoHigh Level This is how you automate everything that we've just talked about plus a lot more features that we're going to talk about next These are all things that you can automate Automation inside of GoHigh Level is literally the backbone or the glue of everything that you're doing for a client So for instance if I'm running an agency and I'm building websites for people and I have a form on each website that the customer has to fill out in order to get I don't know like a bid or an offer or something like that you have to go in the automation section to actually create all of the automated follow-up campaigns the text messages the emails anything to allow it to actually function and work is built right here in the automation section And now we even have build using AI which is just insane By the way I did a whole video on this and I have a ton more that I'm going to be doing But building with AI is going to make your guys' lives so much easier cuz check this out I can click on build using AI and I can just type in whatever I want AI to build me So for example let me show you how simple this is Build me an automation followup for a landscaping company that is running Facebook ads I want the follow-up to be SMS and email both So both text message and email I want it to last 2 weeks but only have seven follow-up messages Once the follow-up is complete if the customer does not respond please delete them from the contact list So this is actually pretty simple This is not a crazy thing to build but it would still take 20 or 30 minutes for a professional to do So let's see how fast AI can do it for us All right guys And it is completed Took slightly under 5 minutes but that's still way faster than I could build it And check it out This is the entire follow-up sequence and the entire automation that you're going to need when you're setting up a client for a Facebook ad It's exactly what I asked it to do And don't worry if you're so confused you're watching this you're just trying to get into go high level you have no idea what any of this means Let me break it down super simply for you Basically automations are built like this You have something at the top called a trigger link where you can add the trigger right here If I click add trigger you have all these different things that can trigger an automation to occur Whenever a lead is created a new affiliate sale anything to do with courses anything to do with payments there's a refund that could trigger a text message that says "Hey you've just been refunded." Shopify community accesses I mean it goes on forever I can't break it all down because I do it in other videos Once again it would take me over an hour and a half just to break down the trigger links alone But just know you start with a trigger link something that triggers all of the actual actions to occur And these are the actions So when you're building an automation for a client using Facebook ads the trigger is going to be when someone submits a Facebook lead form I show you guys how to do that in the course how to actually go onto Facebook ads like the actual Facebook ad manager inside of Facebook create the ad itself and the form within Facebook So when someone clicks on an ad they fill out the form That form is then connected to go high level right here And then when they fill it out it triggers all of these automations to go off So it initially waits 10 minutes That's the first action Just waiting It waits 10 minutes I actually might change this And wo it's really good that I check this out cuz this is not 10 minutes This is 100 minutes So even AI has a little bit of a technical error every once in a while We're actually going to change this from 100 minutes to 2 minutes And then we're going to click save So now it only waits 2 minutes I can even change the name right here to 2 minute wait time Save action But that's very important because there are even errors inside of AI So you do not want to 100% rely on GHL AI to build everything for you Still go over everything that you possibly can Make sure it's perfect Next we have the welcome email This is the first email sent for the landscaping company follow-up As you can see it has the subject right here creates a quick email Hello Puts the contact first name Thank you for reaching out We are excited to have the opportunity to help you enhance your outdoor space yada yada yada Make sure you read all that Make sure it's good Cancel And then it goes on to an SMS welcome message This is a text message that's going to send out as well Thank you for your interest in our landscaping services We'll be in touch soon to assist you yada yada yada This goes on wait after first day See it waits one day and then it sends out the next email the next text waits 2 days keeps doing this over and over Once again check it Make sure it's all perfect But this saved me so much time by having AI create the base for me And then I can go in and edit everything that I want And by the way guys this was such a simple process in a very simple automation It goes way crazier than this I've seen automations that are huge You could zoom in like this far out and they're still all right here Like there's so many automations It just scrolls for hours because you can literally automate the entire business everything in a business that can be as advanced as you want or as simple like this one as you want But when you get into go high level just know this is going to be something that is like second nature to you after a month or two or 3 months And after 2 or 3 years you're going to be able to create the craziest automations of your freaking life especially with how advanced AI is getting in the first place You can even come over here to type message and change it right here So if there's a problem that you don't want to fix you can just type in the message and AI will change it for you in real time Then of course you're going to come up here You're going to change the name of the workflow So this would be like followup for Facebook ads something like that a follow-up for Facebook ads landscaping ads whatever it is you put it right here You click from draft to publish It'll give you an error message If you have any errors this one says there's still an error on the final weight reply I think that's at the bottom right here Yeah final wait for reply And then reply to Honestly I wouldn't even put this I would actually take this one off because we did ask it to remove from the contact if they didn't reply So I'm going to click plus right here And I'm going to go over to delete contact Click save action And it says right here we cannot do this unless it is the last action Of course it has to be the last action So let me delete this Just wait for reply real quick Delete the action Delete right here Click plus Go back to contacts Go to delete contact which is what I wanted to do at the end Save it And boom We delete the contact after the last SMS And I don't want it to delete right after the last SMS So I will put a wait time right here And I'm going to wait one whole day for them to respond Click okay So here's what I did guys We have this huge follow-up campaign that lasts 2 weeks If they reply on any of these the automation stops I can click on settings right here and I can click on stop on response I want the automation to stop completely So if they respond on day two it stops If they respond on day six it stops But then I can go back to the builder and if they don't respond on any of these days it's going to keep on going It's going to keep on going past day four day five all of these different days until we get 2 weeks and seven automations later It's going to wait one full day at the last automation and then it's going to delete the contact completely It's not going to be in the contact list anymore We're not going to be able to message these people anymore That's exactly the way that you want to do it You want to follow policy You do not want to get in trouble You need to follow the regulations of A2P and this is exactly how you can do that in the best way possible We do not want that contact If they're not responding after two weeks they're probably not interested So just remember that when you're building that for a client or for yourself You guys got to kind of watch me build one in real time there or actually have AI build it for me You're going to click from draft to publish and you're going to save it and you're good to go Obviously I'm not going to use this so I'm just going to head back out But that is automation in a nutshell This is actually what I would spend most of my time on if you're a beginner in GHL building automations and building websites Which brings us to the next tab one of the most important tabs in all of Go High Level websites and funnels So right here we have the funnel section and then right here we have the website section If you do not know the difference between a website and a funnel they're basically the exact same thing Funnels are usually one or two pages long very small and they're used to get you to do something So most people will use a funnel when they're running a course or they're running some type of ad And then websites are usually longer They're usually five or six pages long And they're used to inform you of something Websites tend to look a little bit nicer So I build websites quite often but I love building one or twopage websites Websites do not need to be 10 pages long They just don't need to be No one is going through a 10-page website They're not doing it They're staying on the first page on the first paragraph of the first page For a plumber a lawyer HVAC whatever it is they're just trying to get in touch with the business owner So if you're trying to run an agency and you're trying to build websites which is the greatest entry point for any agency ever then you need to focus on that Building websites right here Never start from blank cuz that's just dumb Click on from templates Click on continue And check this out All these websites are already done All you have to do is put in the name phone number the lo phone number the logo the business information and you're done You're literally good to go It could not be easier So if you're watching this and you want to build websites for people which you should do then your life should be so much easier by using GHL You just click on choose template It adds the template Should be done in under 2 minutes And there we go Now it's going to take us inside the website builder right here Looks beautiful I love it already All I have to do is change the photos the logos and change all the buttons and the spacing It's It's honestly already perfect I mean these websites are perfectly fine 99% of your clients will be very happy with a website that looks like this You just need to know how to edit it So if you're new to Go High Level you're nervous about editing it This all kind of uh scares you because you don't know what each button does then go watch all my videos on YouTube about the website builder I break down everything you could ever want to know Literally every button inside the website builder I break down Once you learn how to do this built with automations you can make money There are thousands millions of businesses that want you if you just knew how to do those two things on GHL Mix that with AI and you're unstoppable Your agency is going to crush So learn these things I promise you won't be disappointed But let's get out of here We also have stores webinars analytics blogs WordPress client portals forms Forms are really really important This how you're going to build the forms that go on the websites Check this out I can click add form go to a template click continue Businesses need to have custom forms So you can actually build them from scratch or you can just use the templates right here Super super important because the forms go on the websites that connects to the automation which connects in the conversations tab See what I mean everything connects into one It all comes full circle Learn how to do all these connections Learn how to automate all this stuff and you will love go highle even more than I do So there you go That's forms We've also got surveys quizzes and chat widgets if you guys want to build chat widgets which you should definitely do Every single website that you build for every client for yourself no matter what it is should have a freaking chat widget guys And the chat widgets are amazing We have all-in-one chat widgets text message and email chat widgets chat widgets for Facebook only WhatsApp chat widgets voice AI chat widgets which means you can literally build a website click on the bottom and the website starts talking to you and then it can give you all the answers that you want I actually just made a video on YouTube about this with Declan It's freaking awesome The voice AI is so advanced It's doing so well and it just keeps on getting better every single day You can just sell voice AI You could go around to businesses in your area say "Hey I already know you have a website I saw it online I don't want to build you another website You can keep that one Just let me add my chat widget my voice AI chat widget to your website and I promise it's going to change the game." So many agencies and business owners just do that You don't have to build the website on GoHigh Le It does help and it's a lot better if you do but there are tons of different ways to take chat widgets take automations take anything in GHL and combine it with other softwares All right guys that is the funnels and websites one of the most important features you can learn inside of Goi Level especially in 2026 and when you're getting started Next we have the membership area This is not very important for any beginners This is if you're a coach and you're building courses or communities you would do that in here but most of you watching will not be doing that so we're going to skip that After that we have the media storage section This is where you house all of your media videos photos and stuff like that Not very important Reputation management Another one that's not that crazy important for a beginner but once you connect your Facebook and your Google My Business you can actually get Facebook reviews and GMBB reviews of course And this is where you're going to connect that and get all of those reviews I use this every once in a while but not that important Then we have reportings tab Another one that's not super important for a beginner but I'm going to break it down because that's what I do This is where you can actually create custom reports for your clients or for yourself for Google ads Facebook ads call reporting agent reporting all that stuff You can create that all right here So you can break down the ads how the conversions are doing If you're a social media marketing agency this will come in handy for sure If you're running ads for someone this comes in handy But for the most part it's just a glorified reporting tab All right guys Now we're going to come down to the settings tab This is going to be the last thing that we talk about is the settings inside of the sub account This is still super super important Most of what you're doing when you're setting everything up is in the settings tab So let's click on settings The first section is business profile This is where you find the location ID Now this is different than the relationship ID that I talked about before When you click on the question mark up here you will see the relationship number This is completely different than the location ID If you ever have any serious issues with a certain sub account you can actually start a chat and send a location ID to one of the go high level support agents Then they can go and find that exact location and help fix the problem So if you ever can't find it it's right here under the business profile This is also where you put in all the information for that business itself And this is specific to the sub account So think of this as a client This is all the client's information You can put it right here or you can go over to my profile and put it in the profile section which is going to be specifically to the person So we've got business which is for the business profile which is for the actual individual Next we've got billing This is going to be specific for the sub account as well Now this is usually only used for SAS pro people So if you're not on the SAS pro plan then you're probably not going to use this But if you are on the SAS pro plan then you definitely want to have a payment method for all of your clients But if you're on the $297 or $97 plan you do all of that through Stripe itself I'm not going to break it down in this video because I break it down in so many other videos especially for onboarding and I even give you the snapshots to do it for you So I'm not going to do it but check that link in the description below Go through the courses go through everything and you will get set up completely and I'm just trying to get you guys informed Next on the list we have your staff So this is similar to that team section I showed you guys earlier but it's specific to the sub account Once again so this is the staff for the specific sub account itself only the people that can see this sub account the serial system sub account That's the staff that's in here And you can categorize it by user role or admin user any of that stuff You can kick people add people promote people whatever you want to do Right here I'm going to scroll down a little bit Calendars This is where you create the calendars In the settings tab we already went over this Email services This is really big You do not want your emails to land into spam So the best way to do that is to add a service at the top right Click on your SMT provider and then create a dedicated domain and IP So you can click on dedicated domain right here As you can see I have my SSL certificate already issued so I'm good to go This helps my email hello@ donbaptist.com not land in spam so much If you click on add domain you just put in your domain right here It tells you exactly how to do it And it's going to give you a bunch of complicated DNS records I promise it's not that hard It's pretty easy to do You're going to copy and paste those DNS records inside of your DNS records And once they all get approved you're good to go That's your dedicated domain Your email will stop landing in spam as much and you will have a good email provider So that's how that works I would do this for all of your clients if I'm being honest It'll just make your GHL account work that much better Now let's talk about the phone systems This is also super super important Maybe one of the most important things I know I've said that a lot but there is no better feeling than seeing this green notification right here that says you are now A2P 10DLC compliant This means that I am legally regulated and I can now send text messages from my account You have to do this with all of your sub accounts So you need to figure it out I know it's annoying I know it's frustrating but you have to do it And if you follow everything that I say in my videos if you follow them word for word you will get approved every single time for every client that you have And like I said there's no better feeling than getting approved for A2P having your own phone number and being able to add that number right here of course where you can click on add phone number type in the area code that you want and then just choose it right here You can do this for all of your clients including yourself And then it just makes everything a go high level work so much better The text messaging the chat widgets the automation the AI text messaging AI can use one of these numbers to text message everyone back So definitely get this I'm not going to go super in-depth I'm not going to show you guys how to do it in this video cuz I break down the entire A2P process It's over here in the trust center Obviously I've already registered so I can't do it again But you would click start registration right here and right here And you would register your business or the client that you're adding There's a lot that goes into this guys You need to have LLC's privacy policies multiple different things so that you can get approved and regulated But don't worry I give that all to you if you're my affiliate You get it all Well not the LLC You got to go get that yourself But I show you how to get it You can literally have an LLC done in under 48 hours It's not hard guys None of this stuff is actually hard You just have to do the work So that's the phone system I'm going to scroll down here a little bit longer our way down here We're going to go to integration And this is where you can actually integrate everything Your Google calendar your Google ads your local service ads on Google I talk about that in my course too It's really really cool Your Google My Business your Facebook and Instagram account so you can run ads QuickBooks Wave Shopify Tik Tok the list goes on guys All your major integrations are done right here
