ID: 4c1784e7-bf75-46ac-9f0a-cc373ca6e1b2

i'm looking for the best ski equipment rental in Denver but I'm not just looking for skis i'm also looking at the data so as we search I'm going to stop and give you actionable SEO advice on exactly why Google chooses these results and point out the mistakes that you need to avoid i'm even going to solve the mystery of how a shop with very few reviews can crack the top three now I'm Caleb Welku i run a sevenfigure SEO agency so let's go ahead and start the search so here we are of course on Google itself it's just into 2026 i've never skied before so I don't have any equipment so let's do ski equipment rental Denver so of course we're going to skip all the sponsored results i'm interested in how Google's algorithm works not who can pay the most to get a click okay so here we go we have three ski rental options uh the top three right here in the map results so these three are actually features from the Google business profile these aren't their actual websites so let's go ahead and open up their actual websites so I can click and then open the website i can click here open his website click here and open that website now all three of these have quite a few reviews let's see what their websites look like oh the other one gave me 25% only 15% here close that but now I get 20% off no discounts on the third one so in general when we see popups like that it's usually a bad sign people who visit your website for the first time they don't want to get hit by a with a popup straight away i don't know if I want 20% off i've never been to this website before why would I give you my email address i've never seen anything before so give it a little bit of a delay before that popup comes up and you'll see more conversions okay so let's just take a look at this GBP landing page remember I'm looking for ski equipment so what we want to focus on as somebody who is building the website once someone lands on that website we need to focus on goal completion so what that means is me as a user I'm looking for skis obviously I landed on the ski equipment rental website so we want to make sure that the first thing I see on that website is about why I should rent skis from this business okay there are a lot of competitors in this area that offer the same service why should I rent from them now they had the popup with the discount that's not really what I'm after because I'm looking for the best possible place to rent equipment from and I don't really want to give all of my information to someone where I just landed on their website 30 seconds ago so let's take a look at this landing page okay so we get free shipping not a big deal because hey I'm going to be in Denver isn't that exciting okay uh so I'll look at their title tag what we typically want to see in the title tag is the primary category we're trying to rank for along with the business name so that would be ski equipment rental Denver they're pretty close we have ski and snowboard rentals and repairs in Denver so they have the city name they don't have the word equipment not bad now remember the first thing that we look at right above the fold is what do we see we see an image of a strip mall uh I see pet food supplies yeah not great right i I mean obviously they're the Christy Sports Ski and Patio over here but like why is there an image of pet food right here this uh this is a lost opportunity we could be looking at an image here of people skiing uh with Christy equipment or inside the store showing all of the availability that they have we have address hours not necessary to be this big and take up the full amount of space above the fold remember we came here from the GBP so we already know exactly where it is if we're trying to drive there we can get directions very easily we can call it from right here so we don't need the address quite this large i do like the hours i would make this smaller uh overall let's see what else we have okay so this is good ski packages reserve and advance save i like seeing this remember as the business you want to give the searcher what they're looking for as fast as possible so if they had made this a little bit smaller chosen a better uh hero image we could have seen this come up a little bit uh and that would have got me really like okay ski packages reserve an event and save that's this is great i like that they have uh these different option levels again I don't know anything about skiing so I don't know what demo ski package versus premium and why the demo ski package is so much more expensive i I don't know i maybe would like some explanation on that maybe this is just something super common that everyone knows about oh and then I have a sports key package over here i can see this is the least expensive of the three but why is demo more than premium demo seems like you know just a sample isn't that usually like a demonstrate i don't know i don't know what this means again I'm not a skier but a lot of people who are trying to rent ski gear aren't skiers right if if you're a serious skier you probably own ski equipment you're not looking for a rental okay let's just keep seeing what we have snowboard packages no problem they're they're serving both so I'll just scroll past this snowshoes you're at a ski mountain who's renting snowshoes do people go on ski mountains and snowshoe around does that seem fun to people anyway okay this is an excellent example of uh exactly how you should not build a GBP landing page remember I talked about goal completion and they did a good job up here right all of these packages uh all this information about it i don't really know what everything means but it's still pretty good then when I get down here I just get about this place and some boring trit information this isn't anything about like this particular place right we have a GBP embed fine other locations why do I need other locations i looked at this one with my Google search this feels like a lost opportunity i want to see more information about why I should rent ski gear from them that gets goal completion done okay and goal completion is a rank factor google wants to see that when someone lands on your website they don't go back to Google search they land on their website your website fixes their issues and then they move on and happily with their life if they land on your website and then go back to Google search that's a really bad sign that means your website didn't meet their goals if that keeps happening uh you're going to lose rank position and it's very similar for calls if somebody calls you and you don't answer the phone that's a really bad sign for ranking so we want to make sure that we're focusing on goal completion this is not that customer reviews this is great i might not highlight that 90% of customers recommend this store that's kind of a weird thing to focus on 4.6 out of five with 672 reviews that looks like it's the Yeah it's the exact same number from the Google business profile but my issue with this is they have used colors different from Google's colors this looks like it's the Google reviews that are embedded and that's what I'd like to see right like as a customer as a searcher as a user I don't want to see reviews that are on their own platform because they can make that up right they can write whatever they want if they control the review platform i'm not saying they're doing that of course because these look like Google reviews but I want them to look more like Google reviews this is a simple fix for anyone running a website like this and really what this means for you is that we want to keep Google's standard colors because Google's colors build trust i don't care if Google's colors don't match your brand we're trying to build trust with the users and this Google review embed I want this to be like right up here maybe above the snowshoes cuz who cares about snowshoes but I want these reviews to be higher cuz social proof is a big deal i probably want to get rid of 90% recommend this store that doesn't sound as good as you think it does this is also too long like there's a way to embed these reviews where they come horizontally you cut more of the reviews off if you just see the stars that's what's important anyway i don't want to have to scroll so far so bulk them up uh horizontally have four or five reviews where you can see the star rating and then you can see you know a couple of words of the review you don't need to have the entire review uh and all this information uh right we don't need to repeat that this the address over and over again this is all just wasted space that I have to scroll past store services this is fine this is a very common technique that we use uh the way this applies to you when you're building your website uh we want to make sure that we have all of the secondary categories and the most important services mentioned on the homepage and then linked to detailed pages that expand on those services and categories they've done that here that's great i'm interested to see what's below here because again remember most people aren't going to spend more than 15 or 20 seconds on your business website before they decide whether they're going to convert or not uh this is just a random block of content um this could be improved again focused on why people should go to this store not just talking randomly about Denver okay anyway so this is pretty good right free shipping one year and two-day return policy price match guarantee these should be higher right these are all reasons why I should meet my goal with this particular company which I can't even remember the name of is it Cherry Creek oh Christie right okay join our text list nobody's going to do that all right so overall not a bad job this is a highly competitive search I'm sure in the Denver area um a couple of things that I would reorganize and refocus on for this homepage but overall this is pretty good which is why it's ranked number one let's take a look at the number two same type of thing we get this popup straight away and would you like 15% off i don't know i don't know if I'm going to buy anything here yet okay this popup should come later when I'm closer to buying something maybe when I click on a link that takes me uh to more information about equipment that I can rent something like that but just having this popup straight away and if I'm sure if I hit yes I get Yeah I don't want to give you my email address i haven't spent any time on your website before i don't know if you're interesting i don't know if I like you so go away okay again check the title tag some of the most important content on the website we get Denver ski snowboard mountain bike skate and surf shop boy that's a lot of things no problem they got the city name in there and they got well their primary category what is their primary category let's look at Evo Denver ski shop okay and they are ski rental service that's a good c primary category for the search I typed and what are they small bit okay ski shop uh so we got two ski shops and one uh ski rental service no problem those are pretty close so I don't know about all of the skate and surf and all of that mentioned here like is surfing a big thing in Denver do a lot of people go to Denver to search i mean I've not been there this will be my first visit there so maybe Denver is a really big surfing city feels unlikely because it's really far away from the coast but yeah okay maybe the fact that this is a surf shop is really important to include in the title tag then right just underneath the title tag in terms of importance is our primary heading and their primary heading is Evo Denver not great again we want to include the primary category and the city name and a reason for goal completion remember everything above the fold is so important to convince someone that their goals will be met by this website okay this 15% off thing again let's get rid of that okay this hero image again fine i'm guessing this is an image of the store it's certainly better than the image of the dog food store we saw on the prior website but let's go ahead and keep going okay boot fitting that's a strange thing to have so high on there um Google review embed GBP embed location hours i would be pushing all of this further down the fold this content here uh the reason this is important for you if you're building a website uh when you're building a website especially one for a local business this content that's right below the hero image is so critical to catch people's attention for goal completion they're wasting it on hours the GBP embed I do like ski and snowboard service rentals the boot fitting being above it it's not good for me maybe for them the boot fitting is more important in which case this order can make sense that's something I would definitely want to check with the business owner like what's more important to them a boot fitting or ski and snowboard rentals uh whichever one's more important should be on top but I'll forgive him cuz this could be boot fitting could be more important okay and then we just have a bunch of random links here this is not a very good way to structure this um what I talk about in my school community is how to actually build a GBP landing page that will give Google's algorithm what it's looking for and also give users what it's looking for so what we would want to do with something like this is have subheadings that talk about these core services and under that subheading we would have 50 75 words talking about that service and then a link from there to a detailed page where we can talk about that service in more uh granularity uh we'd structure the internal linking from the homepage to the services from the homepage to the categories to the services below that we'd structure all of that to exactly mirror the structure that the Google business profile itself has i call that the core 30 method now if you want the exact checklist that we use to fix issues like this there's a link in the description grab that and you'll have the chance to join my private school community i have over 3,000 members in there and I hand you uh the low competition ranking method and the exact foundation that we use at my agency for every single new client that we bring on board so honestly you can stop guessing and just steal our SOPs just steal what works and this this doesn't work very well not for users okay again we get bike service fine no problem some random photos and remember I'm still looking for some social proof here why should I make the trek out here why should I call why should I contact them events okay fine honestly I would probably push these events much farther down on the page if I'm going to go to one of these events I probably care a lot about this business maybe I'm a frequent customer i go here a lot there's no reason to try to get me to come to one of these events if this is my first time on the website and for somebody who comes to this business quite a bit go comes to this website quite a bit you can put these events down below you can even put uh an events tab on top on the navbar so that it's easy to find and I don't see events up here so that's uh a bit of a lost opportunity i wouldn't waste space on this GBP landing page i would put a tab uh so that someone looking for events can find them but we don't want to fill this up with stuff like this for people who've never been to this business people who've never been to this website before okay see what's in store fine some featured inventory i mean again I don't really see any reason to convert yet this is just listing things for sale they actually have a video about a mural i don't know this isn't convincing me to call this company because they have a mural right again I'm looking for ski equipment rental i don't want a history lesson about the mural in their store i It's kind of strange to me all right and that's it okay so they don't have very much that is convincing me why I need to reach out to them why I need to join their mailing list take a look at the third one now what's interesting we can see straight away in the third one they actually haven't even bothered to put a favicon on you can see the favicon is this wee little logo here you got the Google theirs theirs and then they just went with the default which I don't know feels kind of lazy like come on get get a get a favicon it's not that hard and their uh homepage title tag is nothing there isn't a homepage title tag honestly that's way worse i was so distracted by the favicon that I missed they don't have a title tag wow okay your local discount C ski this is the primary heading also not great and again I'm not seeing a bunch of reasons to to for goal completion here they're just All right hopefully you can all understand why this is just a really bad website like this this does not give me any information on it so by far uh Christy Sports is the best website and it's not particularly an amazing one but it's so much better than the other two let me do something that no one ever does on Google search right google is giving me these three results that means these three locations have done what Google's algorithm wants to see they've uh optimized their websites for Google's algorithm the best that doesn't mean they're the best place to find ski equipment and I'm looking for the best place for ski equipment so I'm going to look at more places okay oh that's funny so Evo and Christy Sports Cherry Creek are both also sponsoring but we'll ignore the sponsored i'm not going to make them pay because I'm clicking on it right now but okay same top three christy Evo Out of Bounds and let's see what's below uh so we have Larsson's open that website another Christy Sports this isn't super interesting it's just called Denver Ski Company that's a really convincing real business name there uh I guess they have a photo of it there but still i mean this this feels a little Anyway another Christy Sports and then we get Breeze Ski Rentals not great reviews hey look at this 4.8 that's pretty good let's check out Eskimo so many Christy Sports epic Mountain Gear maybe not so epic only a 4.1 mountainside gear rental here we go five stars perfect all right let's see what we got larsson's now again title tag what do we have larsson Ski and Sport wheatidge Colorado i'm guessing they're in Wheat Ridge that's fine they're not in Denver and they have their brand name super common mistake i've said this many times before your primary category and the city name should be in your title tag you will rank higher if you do those things they have decided to just put their brand name in here that's an error don't make these mistakes with your website or your client's website they're ranked number four on Google search for local businesses is the first loser no one sees the business who's ranked number four so if they came and updated their title tag to have the primary category that they're trying to rank for that might be enough to push them into the top three and the number of leads calls inquiries they would get from Google search would go up by 10 times just by doing that the first thing that they have is newsletter signup this we see this with the other two businesses why i don't want to sign up for the newsletter i want to see if they have the things that I want okay i want to see if they're going to offer me a good price on high quality ski gear uh that's easy to pick up easy to return why would I possibly sign up for a newsletter when I don't know anything about this business okay I'll calm down a little bit but this is such a mistake the most valuable real estate on their website they've dedicated to newsletter signup when nobody's going to sign up when they just got here what do we have newest gear and again right this is a ski season ski and snowboard rental view here okay so they do have it right there some featured seis pass bundle helmet basic okay so here we go basic performance premium so this this could make sense okay I and again I might I'd be really interested to know how much of their business is this ski equipment rental if it's a significant part of their business man I don't want to hide this here i want to put like those packages right up on top okay they can even change this and adjust the website based on what season it is it's ski season right now it's January so the number of people interested in ski equipment rentals probably goes up in January so they could even put these on that GBP landing page so that people see it and convert they see that they offer ski equipment what equipment they offer uh straight away as soon as they land and then you know in the summer uh then they can take this off the homepage put something else there uh because this obviously you don't want to talk about how great your ski equipment rental is in July okay so let's see boy this seems expensive right $260 they were like this website is like 52 include a helmet for 17 damage waiver for five upgrade to demo so it is demo is the most expensive okay great rental dates that's the weekend renting for myself okay then some rental information i really want to see what the total price is um let me just come back here okay so we got 175 i'm I'm kind of blown away at how expensive this is $260 skis pose and boots and that's not even the uh that's not even the helmet right why is this so expensive all right interesting uh some other services these images are not great i don't like how these are laid out it's confusing to see uh again I would rather see the subheadings a little bit of content about what that subheading is and then a link to a page that explains it in more detail oh yeah purchase a gift card i mean this doesn't need to be featured on the homepage oh that's the end of the homepage well we have a GBP review that's good there's almost no content on this page i'm kind of surprised they're in the fourth position man if if uh Larsson's here they fix their title tag they add an H1 they don't have an H1 they add an H1 they move this newsletter sign up below they do a Google review embed they have good reviews right when we looked at Larsson's yeah they have great reviews 4.6786 they do a review in bed they talk about why I should be renting from Larsson's their prices are much much higher than Christy Sports doesn't mean that they're a ripoff uh maybe it's higher quality equipment but I can't tell that when I look at it if I look at basic it's still $175 and I love how it says oldest gear i mean why would they advertise that i mean I know this is basic but still it should be more like this is everything you need to Oh that's snowboard but still right let me see what the ski new adult oh so season rental $360 okay so that could be why this is so expensive because it's $360 for the whole season whereas they're advertising for $33 a day man I I just this this this looks so much more expensive i don't know how long the ski season is how many days is that do they only do full uh season rentals not daily rentals this is leaving me with a lot of questions about Larsson's here all right let's take a look at Denver Ski Company world's greatest name title tag nothing it's just the business name luckily their business name is so vague and generic that just the business name they almost got a solid title tag okay Denver Ski Company we'd rather have uh for this primary heading we want to again start focusing on goal completion the hero image is way too big look at how much I have to scroll before I get below the hero image this is just too big of a hero image now one-stop shop i like that welcome to blah blah blah waste okay most people are going to spend a a second trying to read this paragraph just scanning it and they're going to start at the beginning and you're welcoming to the Denver Ski Company a terrible way to start that's just vague local skippable crap so very few people are going to ever keep reading um this should again focus on what I get when I go there okay so again I mean this is just a weirdly lowquality image that they've decided to go with they priced it based on seasonlong pricing maybe that's common here uh in Denver maybe they don't do a lot of daily rentals but I don't know i'm there for the day but then right here rent three days get the fourth for free but why are we advertising a full seasonl long rental ah that seems confusing to me and then that's it that's the end of the page again we're missing content we're missing information we're missing the focus on goal completion these are the things that not only get you to rank higher remember this business wasn't rank high fixing these things will not only get them to rank higher they're going to get more conversions more calls more customers from the people who do all right let's go to this next website that's not great right and here I thought that ski rentals in Denver everything would be dialed in everything would look great all of the websites would be set up properly and instead we get this so I'm just going to move on to the next one obviously this needs to be fixed this is simply unexcusable hopefully this is a business owner who built their own website because man if they're paying someone and this is the level of service they're getting from paying for it I'm I'm embarrassed for the agency they hired hopefully they did this themselves and regardless this needs to be fixed okay on to Eskimo this isn't nearly as annoying it's not full screen but still I don't know anything about them yet this sliding hero image we've actually split tested this multiple times uh across multiple clients of ours people typically don't like these sliding hero images uh they're uh distracting uh they create bounces uh that people will typically leave and then go to someone else's website when they see these so generally we try to avoid them but let's keep going some brands this feels like a website that someone built to show off that they can do all these fun things uh but they make it distracting like this this isn't making me want to click this isn't making me want to buy things from them i mean if you're an e-commerce store or you're a local business like this right one thing that I often will talk about is that success leaves clues so if we take a look at the world's most successful e-commerce store do we have bouncing graphics moving graphics like things that move and bounce um yeah I guess we have a little bit here on the hero is sliding but not very much else okay these aren't like bouncing around uh like we have here okay this is just too much it's too much a lot of people paddling and kaying in January i do like this they've updated it 2026 again I'm looking for rentals but they are an actual store so they do more than just rentals and no no real information here about rentals let's see i don't want that as far as I can tell they don't offer rentals they have nothing about rentals on the homepage at all right i'm not missing it am I i don't want to buy anything i I have to I have to find this little link to click rentals i mean come on oh there we go season Why would they hide this why would they hide this like that uh cuz then if it moves off of this now I got to wait for it to come all the way back and there's nowhere else does it talk about rentals this seems like a real real missed opportunity i I got to assume the ski equipment rental business is pretty good in in in the wintertime in in Denver season rentals daily rentals oh this is what I've been looking for why did they hide this page why was this page so difficult for me to find okay this content is horrible we believe in the philosophy of providing a quality experience for everyone i mean come on right come on of course they do that's what everyone says that's not interesting that's just platitudes this has to talk about why I should rent from them and we believe in the philosophy of providing a quality experience does not do anything for me and we need to be specific why specifically are they the best ones in the Denver area to rent ski equipment from ah this is competitive okay now they only have the adult oh no adult standard demo maybe the demo package just means better skiing let me see let me see can Google help me demo package ski gear meaning AI overview here we go so a demo package is high-end gear maybe I should have known that but again I haven't skied before first time right so 50 bucks a day what are Christy's at for demo $53 a day so I can save $3 with Eskimo so I kind of like Eskimo here how was the reviews cuz we got Christiey's 4.672 come down where's Eskimo there we go 4.8 224 so uh I think Eskimo is going to be the winner here um they have a uh not as many reviews a higher quality of reviews it doesn't look as corporate christy is obviously a franchise i'd much rather support a smaller business than a franchise can I figure out are they a small business or are they a franchise i guess Rentals is right there too but still I'm looking for some sort of about us there we go about us yeah family-owned oldest ski shop in Colorado they've been around for 85 years they're the oldest in Colorado it feels like they're just ranking because of that age where they are uh the ranking is not great this is a massive opportunity for this local business to rank higher if they just come in here and fix a few things with their website it would mean a lot for them we even have some YouTube uh they've been featured in a bunch of these magazines so all of these features all of these mentions that's really good for ranking both on Google's algorithm and on AI recommendations in fact let's take a look and see what chat GPT says if I go chat GPT who is the best to rent ski equipment from in Denver so these two are in the top of Google's algorithm denver ski company we looked at they weren't on top they were just below the top three got Lenny Larsson's we looked at and I don't see them on here kind of surprised that they aren't on here with these types of mentions this really just comes back to improving the website improving the structure improving the topical relevance uh cuz remember I specifically look for rentals and they don't really talk much about rentals on their homepage their primary category though is ski rental service we see this sometimes with Google where it'll show a different category here than the one here this is actually their primary category ski shop the ski rental service is what Google is showing me because I search for ski rental so that's why this and this don't match not uncommon so I had to ask it specifically about Eskimo but it does uh have good information about it yeah it's interesting so it seems like maybe it's in a rough place it doesn't have the larger inventory uh it's not a specialty shop and it doesn't have uh it's not a budget choice so it's kind of in this weird space um but anyway I still like it oldest one in Denver my choice is going to be Eskimo um so that's what I'm going to go
