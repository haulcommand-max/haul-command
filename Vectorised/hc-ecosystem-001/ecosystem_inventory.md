# Ecosystem Inventory: The Missing Weapons

The strategy is 100% mapped. The infrastructure is 30% built. Here are the specific "weapons" that are still needed to complete the **Hyper-OS**.

## 1. The Automation Layer (Anti-Gravity / The JJ Keller Killer)
- **Status**: **READY FOR BUILD**
- **The Tool**: A headless browser agent that authenticates with state DOT portals (e.g., Alabama, Texas) to pull live constraint data.
- **The Gap**: We have the portal URLs; we need the Selenium/Playwright scripts to bridge the data into our Supabase schema.
- **Impact**: It replaces the human job of checking JJ Keller or manual government maps. **This is our Nuclear Weapon.**

## 2. The Decision Engine (Feasibility Engine)
- **Status**: ROADMAPPED
- **The Tool**: A calculator that accepts load dimensions (L/W/H/W) and cross-references the **Regulatory Knowledge Graph**.
- **The Gap**: The backend logic that tells a broker "This load is impossible at this price."
- **Impact**: Becomes the "Decision-Support" tool every broker checks before they quote a shipper.

## 3. The Trust Layer (Reliability Standard Interface)
- **Status**: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN READY
- **The Tool**: The public-facing submission funnel and the private admin triage interface.
- **The Gap**: We have the schema plan, but we need the front-end capture logic (Identity verification + Scoring).
- **Impact**: Institutionalizes the reputation economy.

## 4. The Content Factory (Remotion + HeyGen Rail)
- **Status**: PARTIALLY BUILT (Scripts Ready)
- **The Tool**: An automated pipeline that takes internal regulatory data and generates "Member Spotlights" and "Value Bombs."
- **The Gap**: The HeyGen Clone Prototype and the Remotion template for daily "Load Intelligence."
- **Impact**: Automates the Authority Engine (E-E-A-T).

## 5. The Logistic Layer (Staging & Install Rail)
- **Status**: DATA IDENTIFIED
- **The Tool**: A vehicle configurator for "Kit Building" and a "Heavy Haul Staging Map" (Location Intelligence).
- **The Gap**: The extraction of the 50-state truck stop parking data and the scheduling logic for the install network.
- **Impact**: Solves the "Staging" and "Outfitting" pain points.

---
**Goal**: Complete the "Infrastructure Smash."
**Progress**: 13/20 Revenue Streams architected.
