TITLE: Antigravity Skills are a Cheat Code (NEW System)
ID: b2e0654b-34d5-413b-9a4a-010e60ef3d94

google's anti-gravity have just released skills and it is a cheat code if you know how to use them correctly imagine if you could build anything faster than everybody else and to a better quality and in this video I'm going to give you a complete beginner's guide to anti-gravity skills so that you can build faster to a way better standard and I'm also going to show you how they compare to Claude skills why they're different and some other really key updates on anti-gravity and if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts i built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a sevenf figureure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in so the team at anti-gravity and Google have just released anti-gravity skills and they have a couple of incredible benefits first of all when you create something excellent in anti-gravity we can now make that super repeatable which means that we can do it every single time on repeat consistently on top of that you're also going to save so much of your context window when using anti-gravity if you use the skills on top of that it also becomes super sharable and very scalable which means the skills that I build and I'm going to show you in this video I'm going to give you all of them so you can use them straight away i'll put a link down below where you can share it with your team and it just makes all of the environments super scalable you basically become if you want to think about it this way Tony Stark and the skills are like the Iron Man suit now if we think about it technically well skills are reusable packages of knowledge that extend what the agent can do each skill contains basically instructions of how to do the thing best practice what to do and then optional scripts and resources and the skills in anti-gravity are different than Claude and you'll see what I mean in a second so you can basically create a skill for anything onboarding systems database migrations competitive intelligence systems or even design protocols it's kind of like the Matrix nobody see what they plug him in he's like I know kung fu that's kind of what skills are going to be like within your anti-gravity environment now when do I use skills right when would I actually physically do this well whenever you find yourself repeating a prompt it's probably a good indication that you want to build a skill so you never have to repeat yourself you're at the gold standard once and then you can just call that in perpetuity whenever you want to and improve on it it's really cool what about Claude skills Jack cuz I've seen a lot about that online these days well Claude if you think about it now they are very similar but there's a key difference think about the Claude skills as knowledge whereas anti-gravity is knowledge but it's actually more automation i'll show you what I mean so club code in this analogy is like a worldclass chef okay and he's got a library of cookbooks these are its skills if you if you will now when you ask Claude code to do something what it does is goes to this beautiful library and grab that skill and it reads the book reads what the skill says and then once it's done that based on the information that it read within the bug cloud code will then go and do it so I'm chef i'm Claude called code i've read the book now I realize I'm going to run a Python script i'm going to do something random okay you think about it another way you have yourself here which is me in a tank top and we give a command to Claude code and Claude code reads the skill the book and then it does the actions itself whereas with anti-gravity given the fact that it's an IDE effectively when it activates a skill what can happen here is that the code can actually be part of the skill right so essentially what happens there is that it runs the script within the skill and so each skill in this analogy is like a beautiful pre-made dish and it because it already executes and does everything that we want to so Claude skills think about knowledge anti-gravity the ways I understand it I think about it in terms of automation so Claude must reason write and execute whereas anti-gravity can reason and then execute and this is based on my understanding from going through anti-gravity's own docs and skills and comparing that with claude code so very interesting and actually one interesting thing I want to call out as well is anti-gravity anytime we launch any changes they publish on the change lab but I'll put a link down below so you can check that one out too now to best understand anti-gravity skills you need to use them so what I'm going to do is run you through five critical skills that you're probably going to use every single week within anti-gravity i'm going to give you the full access to all the code i'll put a link down below now the first one we're going to start with here because remember these skills are going to make excellent repeatable which is awesome in other words diligence right it's going to save your token count and it's just going to be overall epic for your environment so the first skill I want you to create is the ability to create other skills so here we go we've got the anti-gravity skills creator this document by the way is based on the information from Claude Docs on all the amazing stuff for creating best practice skills as well as all the specifics for anti-gravity and the unique architecture for the skills there so what I've done I've created it very very cool all you got to do is literally come down and create all of it like so and then we're going to go ahead over to anti-gravity like so and here we are in the environment so I've created a sample project called skill master just open up a random folder and then we're going to give it a prompt and we're going to give it something like this i'm going to say "Hey there I would like you to create for me a global skill called Gemini skill creator and the idea of the skill is that you reference it anytime you're creating any other skill make the skill available across all projects i've put all of the text down below for the skill." Awesome we're going to come down here and we're just going to paste that one in there which is awesome so the cool thing about the chat interface and remember anti-gravity is an agent first software environment so everyone tries to specialize in one thing or another anti-gravity really tries to specialize on you know being specific about um being agent first so we can actually speak to anti-gravity to create the skills and this is the whole idea of coding with our language right that we don't always have to put button clicks anti-gravity can do that for us instantaneously but just to give you a bit of an overview of what does make a good skill cuz you can go very deep on this but top level from anti-gravity themselves you name it you have a description for what it does okay we essentially talk about when it's used it's review checklist and then how to provide feedback to it so you can get some real specifics but you go so much deeper and this prompt goes way way deeper than that we cover things in it like formatting standards the skill name we cover things like writing principle conciseness so how do you actually create the skills what are the best practices and Claude's done such a good job on breaking down all of this stuff and all the specifics which is amazing so as you can see we come back over now we're going to accept all the changes as you can see we've now got the agent skills Gemini skill creator and we've got everything here which is freaking amazing so workflow feedback loops checklist validations lots of different stuff so this is now going to be the skill to create other skills and effectively the way that you trigger these skills should be based on natural language so the idea here is that Gemini will decide when to reach over or whatever model we use within right could be Gemini could be Claude could be anything but the idea is that it decides when to use the skill you can also trigger the skill if you want to be 100% sure that it uses it but in theory it should just trigger it by its natural language and if you ever find it isn't doing that just say "Hey use the XYZ skill." Now Gemini 3 is the best model on the planet today for creating gorgeous and beautiful designs they're crushing it but often times we can find ourselves copy and pasting the same prompts and messages and design libraries so we can solve this with our second anti-gravity skill which is going to be brand design and we can actually use a framework that goes beyond the brand which makes it way more consistent so for example in the brand design skill we can actually create a unique architecture so with this one we have almost like a directory structure where effectively what we have over at the top here is the skill MD which is whenever you're doing anything design you can then decide which of the three almost like subsklls if you like you want to activate and leverage so we can have one for design which colors colors fonts radi make it machine readable we have frameworks and coding rules for like what text you want to use and then copyrightiting guidelines so this is the bit where we could say for example add in hey if you're writing in the voice of you know glido our speechto text startup You could say "Look we want it to be these colors or right in this tone of voice." So it just knows automatically and dynamically when to invoke that specific skill so let's copy all of this right here let's head back over to anti-gravity and give it the prompt which is awesome so I'm going to say "Hey using this skill creator I would like you to create a the below skills for based on the text." Okay cool there we go pop all information in bam send that one off and then again let Gemini work in the background and create those skills for us and then from your purposes what you then want to do is actually load up all of your brand guidelines and information so for example what you do is say "Hey I want you to edit the information and context within those skills based on the blow information and literally just drop it in the chat window or if it's a PDF you can literally drag and drop it on the left hand side and Gemini can read that little hack for you as well by the way if I actually come over and grab like the Glideo brand guidelines right I open this up you can see it's really cool it's got loads of stuff in typography all our text all this cool stuff right what you can do is drag this over into the file and then actually when you want to reference it for example what you can do is say hey I want you to update the information in the brand design guideline skills based on the information within this document okay and then what we do is we do at like so and then we can tag that document right so this is called glido brand guidelines i do glide brand guidelines PDF boom so you can describe that in natural text but this literally grabs the specific route to it and you can just add whatever you want to and then you throw it in there which is awesome little side note by the way if you're looking for inspiration on what do I do this I talk about this often in different videos but if you go to vcrol.dev you come through to playground again what you can do is enter in any business website you want to so the classic example I always use in fact let's even do glido.com right what you can do with this come down mark down and just come down and select branding this will then basically let you go ahead and get all the branding information from a particular website to create a mood board and a vibe to know what you like so if you like the look of glider you think dude this is a really cool brand this really cool business you can see our logo you can see our fabricon you can see our OG image and you can even see the fonting that we're using as well as the specific accents so you could be like I love this i want to do something similar i want to play around with it and you can do that exactly just like that and the other thing that I recommend you do as well is actually upload your logos to the skill as a reference file so when it creates things for you for your website you create new pages or anything like that it knows what logos to use and when so we can test this by saying "Hey I want you to create for me a very simple simple HTML landing pages do it in my brand guidelines and make it just a gorgeous design very simple talking about why coffee is the best drink on the planet." Beautiful we're going to turn that one off and we're going to see how this then actually pulls ahead uses those skills and builds to us something really simple and as you can see down here already guys it's pulling through the skills master agent skills brand identity which is awesome and then it's creating a bit of a mockup with Gemini which is fantastic and I also just want to call out that this is one of the cool things about anti-gravity and the Gemini model being embedded within the chat that when you're doing various different things it can actually generate for us these images which by itself PS is a skill you can make if you're building things you want Gemini to generate images say for your website with the SEO and stuff you can say "Look all the images I want you to generate should be in these dimensions and follow this style and follow this reference image." Meaning you can build that as a skill so you actually automate the creation of these incredible images and now it's completed that and as you can see I gave it one prompt it did it it checked everything for the brand guideline adherence again it leveraged the skills so I wouldn't need to keep repeating myself i can come down and all I asked it for was to open up an local host so we click on local host 8000 and then if we full screen this can we see it feel my progress and what's really cool guys it's grabbed the logo it's followed the exact branding thing and I even show you now just as for instance I'll come over to Glider itself does this does this branding look familiar does it look Does it look like a fast speech to text thing damn right it does but you can tell but it's it's just automatically and even when I'm highlighting it it's gone light green now which is freaking insane obviously it's just now ready to rock and roll i just I think this is absolutely crazy it just saves so much time so you can get that consistent result and here's the key thing about these skills in anti-gravity is that if the result isn't perfect that is so cool just go back and amend it and refine it but once you get that maxle standard it should never fall below that now as you know from my last video looking at what the creator of Claude Co I mean Claude Co does a billion a year in annually recurring revenue so the creator's got some interesting things to say one of those interesting things and I've been talking about this a lot is the importance of the planning stage ask stupid questions get stupid answers and in the same way we can actually improve the quality of our outputs by asking way better questions and we can do that by leveraging again a skill for brainstorming and a skill for planning so there's this amazing repo here which is fantastic and again this is the beauty of skills is that we can all learn from each other and get better as a community which I freaking love so you can see here we've got some stuff here for brainstorming which is a great way of doing it you can see it's brainstorming skill which is skill by MD and it's got lots of stuff so this is about how do you actually create and brainstorm better ideas and then there's going to be a skill for planning which is phenomenal so what I'm going to do here actually is I'm going to come over to the main page real quick which is going to be over here on the code and then we're going to copy the whole thing on code like so and I'm going to copy this and head straight over to our beautiful anti-gravity and then I'm going to say hey using our skill creator MD I want you to grab this GitHub repository and create me two skills one for planning and one for brainstorming awesome okay come down and I'm just going to give it a get and let it do all the work of actually just grabbing it for me and just like that it's now completed it it's done a brainstorming skill and also a planning skill so I might say something like "Hey dude I want to brainstorm some ideas of how I could grow my e-commerce business." Okay something random we send this one off and then we can activate and see how it leverages the skill and just like that you can see it's analyzed skill.md which is awesome i also want to show you as well on the left hand side you can come down to skills we can see this now under planning and skill.mmd under planning and it's given everything we want there so you can see it's got some interesting features here it's an overview write a comprehensive implementation plan each step is blah blah blah and it's got this all this great stuff from the GitHub there and the model itself is now asking clarificatory questions to help us get that and pretty much crush it meaning that you're going to have a consistent robust framework for planning and doing anything we need to with an anti-gravity imagine you built your dream workflow and you're pushing the envelope you're doing something very different invariably at times you're going to run into what is known as a bug or it's just not working properly and when that happens we need to troubleshoot it but the amazing news is that we can actually leverage a skill which has basically been created on all the best practices the common things that go wrong which means that anti-gravity can leverage the skill to fix the error way faster and to do that we're going to leverage this beautiful skill here from this repo which explains all the specifics which is amazing master error handling patterns across languages including exceptions uh result types error propagation graceful so what we can do is literally come down and we're going to copy this entire repo and we're going to share that with an anti-gravity skill and this is one of the awesome things I love about the community of building is that you get to do these things find all the cool stuff and basically like leverage all this cool things that we do together so if I come over then to anti-gravity I'm going to say "Awesome i would now like you to forget what we're just talking about and I want you to create for me a troubleshooting skill which we'll use to basically troubleshoot any application to make sure that it gets fixed." Fantastic and then we're going to throw all that code in there which is awesome and send that one off again you could just give it the GitHub repo if you prefer but alternatively you can just post it and craft these skills yourself dynamically whilst you're talking to anti-gravity and again the key here is that anything that you would be asking of these models or within anti-gravity if you find yourself asking it a few times ask yourself should I just take 2 minutes to write like the best thing I can to get the highest level possible and then I can just use this whenever I need to in any of the applications that I'm building and that takes us very nicely onto our fifth skill which is a really interesting one because it's the idea of running scripts within the actual anti-gravity skill itself so for this one we're actually going to create some code that does something interesting like scrape a subreddit for something and then once that skill's created we'll be able to just say "Hey scrape this subreddit." It will reach over execute the exact code within the anti-gravity skill and work perfectly for us so to do this let's create a skill hey dude what I would like you to do is to create for me a scraper that would scrape the top three posts of any subreddit Reddit I choose i want you to create it validate that it works and let's do it with the NHN subreddit as if for instance so I've sent this one off and the reason why this skill here is actually one of the most interesting and most powerful is because when we validate and prove that you can actually create executable code as a skill we can know and bank on the fact that we can lean over leverage that and use that whenever we want to now I like to build these ones in two steps the idea I've got here is validate the actual execution performance of it then we're going to codify it into a skill using our skill creator and then we can reach over and use it for pretty much anything that we want to so what previously used to have to be a dashboard or a project can actually now just very easily be a skill and again once again we're using MCPS here now think about this the skills themselves are code instructions knowledge practice mcp really is about data data exchange and data gathering so they all work together the you know saying don't use MCP use skills is like saying something like don't eat food drink water like they're completely different things it's like they're just absolutely different things used for completely different context and for our purposes it's very cool because we can do some epic stuff way faster beautiful so within one shot it has done it it's actually interestingly use the old Reddit to do it reliably without the need for any APIs which is really cool so what I'm now going to ask it to do is to codify this into a skill awesome i'd like you to turn this into a Reddit scraping skill for me in line with how I explain you need to be building skills in the skill creator MD beautiful once again I don't need to specify skill creator MD i think that kind of want for it to never go wrong makes us do it but in reality Gemini should know this and the reason why we saved us so much in terms of token usage is that if all this stuff just existed as let's say for example folders on the left hand side which is a way that probably most people are doing it right now because this thing came out like this week you know it'd be burning through your tokens and not everybody is on the supermax ultra mega plan and the thing about that is like you token usage becomes a key thing so what Gemini is going to be doing here is looking into the skill looking through the description saying "Hey you know the Reddit generator skill might be relevant for the thing we're doing let's actually go ahead and use it." So it's cool so now it's literally developing this for us so we're just going to ahead and accept this which is cool and man I must admit I've had a pretty beautiful interesting week we're planning out all the meetups for the community so we're doing South Africa in two weeks then we're doing a meet up in London in March and then one in Japan in April so we'd love to come see you grab a coffee say hello shake your hand we always have great times one of the things we do a lot in the community is in-person meetups i freaking love it it's so good to see people in person so we're going to bug that last time we did I think it was like mini golf it was very cool it got very competitive very quickly we rented out this place in London it was so cool so this is now pip and popping in the background completing everything for us we're just going to accept all to make sure this is all completed and then we can actually test it by creating a brand new chat window and then just asking it to scrape a random subreddit to get a couple of post and I like to do that by testing it in a new window so there's no context it is a fresh brand new conversation now guys check this out can you see now within the scraping Reddit folder we've got resources right we've got scripts so this the Python script is within this so we're not saying "Hey use it's like literally within that right so let's come over and create a brand new chat window which I believe they might have changed where you do this actually I think it is start new conversation cool so let's get rid of this and let's give it a prompt like "Hey can you just scrape for me the top three posts within the singularity subreddit within the last 7 days?" Awesome bam send that one off and then we can see if it actually goes ahead and uses I know it will use our actual beautiful skill but I've not told it to do that it will just then actually have to decide whether it wants to use the skill or not so let's have a look it's analyzing whether the scripting is done analyzing skills.md which is cool so let's check it out and it has decided to use the scraping thing and again it's got description scrapes a top a hot p from specified subreddits and look it's even now using the scraper that's in the Python script there which is awesome this is freaking crazy guys so it's examining it it's just Reddit scraper it's now running in the background it's got all this information this is crazy and you can see now say for example I'm looking at my YouTube channel i might say "Hey just like remind me what were the top posts that I've had so far this week." I create a scraper for it and it's done and look at this we've got the answers driverless fan in China are facing all sorts of challenges atlas ends the year with a back flip atlas has its own moves how freaking crazy is this this is going to sit there for us now on autopilot i can pull that skill whenever I want to and this is just one example but it spun up in like 20 seconds it's ridiculous and so you can see the potential of these skills now one other small update I wanted to call out on anti-gravity we know that it's got a couple of plans a free one one's about $20 and the one was a little bit more expensive if you're on the free plan I understand that at the moment that your quotas used to reset every 5 hours that's now been changed to weekly in other words if you use all your quotota on Monday in a crazy coffee binge like coding session you've got to wait till the end of the week to go back again but as I understand it that does not affect you if you're on like the $20 plan or the pro plan i do kind of think of all the ones I pay for anti-gravity is one I'm like this is great especially because you get access to all the different cla models so it is really epic but taking a step back with this incredible thing right now we've learned how to build these amazing anti-gravity skills that's going to help us build excellent levels way more consistently the next thing that we need to do is actually learn how to leverage these skills and these systems to build like a personal operating system that's going to work for you in the background 247 and you can do that by watching this video right
