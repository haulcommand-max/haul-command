TITLE: AntiGravity Just Changed Content Creation Forever (remotion)
ID: 33e59259-4aca-4a19-a570-8131b094bcda

ai has just changed content creation forever anti-gravity can now create beautiful animations product demos and even edit your videos completely on autopilot this is using Remotion a new skill that just launched and it will change everything and in this video I'm going to show you how you create something so good that you would actually use it and not only that I'm also going to show you hidden capabilities that 99% of users don't even know exists so you can edit videos with AI saving you time and supercharging your business and if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts i built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a 7 figureure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in and after playing with this tool for a bit the stuff that I'm going to show in this video is going to blow your mind for example this right here this interactive dashboard created by Remotion it did it in the exact brand guidelines that I wanted to from my specific website and it did it in one prompt look how similar this is and by the way this is dynamically updated by what exists over here for example if I change this from 85,300 to something like 100,000 and I come back over to the dashboard watch this it's going to change now to 100,000 instantaneously so you have dynamic updates not only that I gave it a video for my notebook LM video and not only did it cut it it also added these exact captions specifically over using the exact same GLO brand guidelines it cut it out specifically and on top of that it also audio enhanced it so listen to this using it skills because it wouldn't that is crazy so it did a complete audio enhancement added subtitles in i gave it one prompt i'm going to show you everything in this video and then you're also going to how you can pull down these assets from your website how AI can read it pull down images pull on anything from your web page and create these videos for literally whatever you wanted to so video with voice let's talk about that specifically remotion which is the engine that makes all of this popular so what is Remotion well the TLDDR of it is that you can make videos programmatically what does that actually mean and why is this so powerful well if you think of it like this what they've effectively done is every frame of a video asset so to speak is code and the idea is that when every frame is code we can use programming to create functions loops conditionals to automate and scale video production video editing graphics animations using AI that's why this is so big you can effectively compose with code which is a very kind of artistic terminology we were composing with code you can export in many formats which is really awesome and just to give you a view of this business you can see they are absolutely blowing up right now hence one of the reasons why we're talking about it the fact that these skills are available and we can now connect it to environments like anti-gravity and cursor and using a terminal i want to call this out that the market for this is huge look at Submagic they did 1 million ARR within 3 months they are a video editing tool uh you had this company here AI video a million a year $5 million a year in annually recurring revenue from an AI adm $6 million a year with Crayo you get the picture so what we're going to do is give Claude which is the AI model we're going to be using within anti-gravity Claude code this remotion skill and we're going to be doing that within anti-gravity and so let's cover absolutely everything that you can do with Remotion so you understand the full capabilities and I'm going to show you how you can use Remotion for your business for your personal life across three levels of difficulty starting with number one which is going to be video editing and enhancing and to do this I'm going to go ahead and grab a really cool asset and I'm going to put a link down below in the description so you can go ahead and grab this because this is going to be really gamechanging for you so let's come up to Remotion Anti-gravity and what we're going to come and have a look at and these are just some examples of the crazy stuff you can do is let's take a look at this magic setup so you you'll find a link for this down below the video so make videos programmatically first thing we need to do is go ahead and install it and there's a couple things that you need to do number one is install it here so here if you haven't downloaded Node.js just go ahead and do that but you can pretty much just copy and paste this and throw it into anti-gravity okay so what we're going to do is literally copy this and then we're going to head over to anti-gravity but before we do that I want to highlight what you can actually do with this so what can it generate so you know it's skills we've got video motion and graphics so intro outro animations explainer videos product demos social media video ads animated infographics logo reveals connected typography and when I made this video I wanted to be something that you would actually use i found a lot of the examples they just don't look good like the text is like this big and the rest of the image it's not it's if it's not something you'd actually use I I don't think there's any point talking about it there is some stuff you can build with this that is incredible so web design and development landing pages marketing sites dashboards admin panels loads of really cool things then a suite of UI and UX assets component libraries design systems loading animations excuse me I'm breaking up even thinking about this navigation patterns form designs data visualizations you get the idea right automation tools content loads of cool stuff so you can look at this for inspiration in building it so let's go ahead and install it so all we're going to do is come down and grab this and head over to our code editor of choice we're going to be using the wonderful beautiful anti-gravity and so here we are within the wonderful beautiful anti-gravity and I want to show you one additional function with anti-gravity about how you can run claude code outside of the chat window within anti-gravity and what I'm going to do is show you how you can use claude code within anti-gravity so we can do it here by just chatting to remote and saying hey occasionally though sometimes anti-gravity you may find that the agent spins up and does something a bit random which is really cool so I just want to show you another technique that you can use so on the left hand side and this is great to know by the way come down to extensions and do me a favor type in Claude and you'll see Claude will pop up here which is awesome right and you're going to install that now if you have the Claude desktop app that should connect automatically then check this out if I just double click in the middle here you'll see the Mystical Wonderful Claude thing pop up so I can click on this guy like so and I can say "Hey Claude what's up?" All right now we're dealing and talking with Claude and you can basically edit automatically do loads of cool things and Claude is talking to us if you ever get any friction with the chat panel bring code up here okay so all you're going to do is basically say "Hey I'd like you to do this excuse me to do this and then throw all the stuff in make sure it's all done." And then hit enter and then let anti-gravity work its magic to make sure all this different stuff is basically updated and you can use it and it's very very cool so you can see it's validating hey I've got Node.js installed which is awesome now it's checking the git which is fantastic once that's done we'll be able to rock and roll and start using this really cool software and a secondary little hack for you as well if you click on this claude thing here to open up Claude Coder here one of the things that you can do is if you want to connect Claude to your MCP servers if you ever have issues here is if you click on this you click on MCP servers and by the way MCP stands for model context protocol what it just basically is is how we connect anti-gravity to the outside world how we connect it to your Gmail and Nan and Zapia and any tool you want to what you can do is click on MCP servers you can click on manage MCP servers and obviously you can add any that you want to right and when you're in this you can see which I just uh basically bring this guy across a little bit so you can see if you click on view raw config you can copy all of that put it into cloud code and say hey create your own MCP config and that will give Claude the ability to access all of your MCP servers just a little hack I wanted to share with you just so you're ready to rock and roll at all times these gems are just they're going to be flowing throughout the video so get ready and hope you hope you're well caffeinated cool so now it's done it's basically installed everything and we should be ready to rock and roll now the first thing that I want to do here and the way that I kind of do it is you can create a new folder here on the on the left hand side called videos or whatever you want to right so if I come down here and I create a new folder and let's call this folder something like videos to edit okay beautiful so we got videos to edit what I want you to do is drop an unedited video within that folder so let's go and grab one from my desktop so I've got one here which is 21 seconds long let's hear what it sounds like the next thing that we need to do is make sure we're leveraging 100% no captions right so this is notebook trim so what I'm going to do is click an X on this right i'm going to grab this i'm going to bring it over and drop it into videos to edit okay cool so now it's within videos to edit and can we hear it which is really cool okay nice so very very very decent so what I want to do is basically add captions so how do I do that well one of the things that you can do if you've got a specific brand or style we can make that happen and so what we're going to do is head back over to our notion document which is over here and what I've done for you is listed all like three really cool use cases that we can do so if I scroll down let's have a quick look workflow one is automated video caption broadcast grade output so we give it the input what it's going to do is analyze and cut so it's going to transcribe your entire video with whisper word level timestamps so this is going to know intelligently where to cut the video and where not to cut the video it's going to pass the transcript and we've given you all these instructions because I did all the I wanted to go and take some time to get deep into this to make sure I can give you something that's really freaking sick it's going to go through and he take two moments so for example often times you if I make a mistake does JR make mistakes yes he does sometimes actually 100% what happens to pass transcript is it will say oh great that was obviously mistake and it will cut that out for you it's going to trim the video then it's going to audio process it using something called which is incredible by the way and you can get started with it for free so it's going to improve your audio output and I'll show you the difference then what it's going to do is a reotion caption engine and that's going to be the thing that adds in the font the biggest mistake that people make with this stuff people don't pay enough attention to detail on the fonts and the size of the fonts the visual hierarchy the whites space how it flows um all these different details we've got all the typography so again we're going to get some brilliant beautiful Google fonts we've got different spaces these are just the ones that I found works best for me um just having a look at it and then basically we've got styling logic so this has been pulled from my website i'll show you that in a second text shadow audio cleanup rules and then we've got the render and the product structure and the execution rules so what we're going to do is literally copy this like so one second let me come and grab uh all of this content like that come all the way down sweet so I'm going to do this i'm going to head back over to anti-gravity which is here and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say tag the project file so do shift at if you type in I think it's videos to edit videos to edit right there it's got one file and I'm going to come down and just paste it in really really cool okay and send that off fantastic now I want to give you another bit of uh wisdom so I've already pre-selected here my own specific brand guidelines but check this out if I double click on the hole here I click on club code which I can open the terminal i just do this because I prefer the interface i might say "Hey dude head over to this website and I want you to extract the brand guidelines terms of the typography i want you to go ahead and grab the logo for me and anything else and then create a file on the left hand side called glido visual identity okay check this out and I go for https.glido.com beautiful i'm just send that one off as you can see this agent is undergoing some kind of improvement right now hence why it's like terminated so what I'm actually going to do is show you right now how you can leverage this claude code thing within anti-gravity if you ever come into basically if you ever encounter a timer like this so we're going to dismiss this we're going to come back over and we're going to copy all this information like so and what we're going to do is just pause this guy for a sec and you know what's really cool let's open another one and now we've got two different cool code tabs and look at this and I'm going to hit that in like that and instead of ask before edits let's just say edit automatically okay and then send it off and we can have multiple of these different instances running for us and this one can be edit automatically so we have one cloud agent that's going out and grabbing information and if you've got a specific brand or style I recommend that you do that yourself so that you can make sure that you know um it basically reflects your brand identity and then we got the second one here which is going to go ahead and do it so look at this ask us some questions what is the path to your video file we are going to say uh custom path i'll provide the full path do you have an Oronic API key set up i'm going to say uh yes different variable name so I want you to do this you can skip if you want to but I highly recommend it like so and I'm going to give it the information so let's go ahead and grab our Oronics API key so to do that click on Brave i'm going to head over to orphonic.com again I use Oronic for like everything it's really freaking cool so this is a free account that I made you get 2 hours of processing completely free i've got the paid version but I highly recommend that you use it so have to come down and grab our API key to do that you're going to click on the cog i believe it is an account settings and then when you scroll down you'll have an API key now you can reset it if you want to get a brand new one for example I could do reset API key yes I'm sure 100% and I get a new one you're just going to copy that then head back over to anti-gravity and once here we're going to finish given information so what is a full path to our video so a full path to our video is right here so you can right click on that you come down and you're going to copy path and you come over and then you're going to go for other and just type in the path there and then it's asking for orphonic key so I'm going to come down and give it the oronic uh key right this just do other and just say this is the API key and then you're just going to paste in the key that you got from oric and then claude can start working its magic in the background then I come back over to our first Claude environment and you can see the SVG logo is glider geometric icon icon uses XYZ so we start to get some brand identity and brand guidelines which is cool but what we can do if we want to get an even more detailed version of it so we're going to say yes that's fine is you can head over to uh let's come over here right now and here you get again overview really cool come to playground all you have to do is type in glido.com which is our speechtoext startup just launched in beta very very fast I must say and you can see now once that's done uh we're going to come down and we can see the branding which is awesome what this will do is basically attack a website i say attack attack is really a powerful word but it'll go onto a website grab all the information data for you and give you everything from it so here you can see we've got the logo we got the primary colors we got the fonts so you can just copy this for any website come back and then build videos in those assets and you can see now look at this it's extracted the video and transcribed it with whisper API it's analyzing the transcript identify clean take and then it's going to process the audio through oronic so often times online for any content people will forgive bad visuals they will never forgive bad audio so that audio crispness is so so important so the fact now that we got this workflow where like we can edit it we can trim it we can like do anything and also get beautiful captions at the right moment is crazy and I just want to say as well you can scale this up to I'd say infinite complexity uh and by that I mean that we can build a series of editing rules we can say hey first of all eliminate all pauses secondly if there's a double take remove the first take and by trial and error you can build up an editing system and you could edit a full video with this 100% but even if you didn't want to you can still save like 80 to 90% on your editing time that will completely enhance all the audio so at the moment for example before this my editor is grabbing my videos what he does he runs it through a right now this could be set up programmatically but it doesn't physically need to do this like that's the level we're getting to now it's really crazy and at this stage we can see it's now running the remotion caption project which is freaking awesome and I love this like the fact that we can edit videos is so crazy like you know imagine like how many more clients video editors could work with now as a result of this it's so freaking cool honestly and what I like the most is the typography we can do the colors we can do and I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like honestly I hope you buckled in cuz this is about to get crazy just want to pull your attention so can you see this look this is when I say it's covered everything so look this has pulled down everything so now we've covered exactly and it's almost to a millisecond here guys everything I've said and where it is and it's pulling up the specifics it's cutting things out it is really freaking impressive it's like video editing software like I started off learning Premiere Pro like when I was actually no first it was iMovi and these other environmental tools include code just keep snatching up and moving into every software imaginable and as you can see right now guys it's now rendering the final video to the desktop now there's a big divide in the kind of like coding community about like do I should I just use the terminal or this you can use a terminal right you can use that terminal to do things in my view though I think visual interface matters for this kind of thing which is why I prefer to build in these environments one thing I also want to point attention to as well is that you can do this for multiple videos simultaneously so for example if I have five videos 10 videos 50 videos I can create so many different just keep on pressing this button basically going through it and each of them will go and work on a completely separate video like that's how we're talking about programmatic like this is why it adds scale you nail the process then you can scale this up using these tools and so like this it's now completed whisper transcription 74 words with all time stamps no edits needed it's already clean fantastic but I can assure you it does editing quite well leveled normalized so it's done or phonics processing and it's deninoised it so we can actually listen to the difference and caption engine okay beautiful so to put it on my desktop so let's head over to my desktop and check this out beautiful so now it has officially completed it so let's compare the difference and as you can see in videos to edit I've got both the previous and the new one so let's check out the difference and I want you to pay close attention to the audio difference you ready so now we've covered exactly how to leverage Notebook LM and combine that with anti-gravity okay so now we've covered exactly how to leverage Notebook LM and combine that with anti-gravity the next thing that we need to do is make sure we're leveraging 100% of anti-gravity's capabilities by using its skills because you see the difference in audio quality guys and the actual transcripts i mean this is literally insane like and that transcription was perfect like genuine look at this it's outrageous all the way through look it's insane using its skills because if we're not using the skills we're not getting the most out of the platform but what if I want to edit it right well check this out and I've just asked it to increase the text by 40% and it will do that for us edit it and then put it there so what we'll have on the left hand side is a videos to edit folder then underneath can be completed edits and if it gives you back anything that you don't like we just say hey basically fix it now the key final step here before I show you the next level is that whenever it's finished I want you to give it the following prompt which is "Hey dude what I'd like you to do is create a system and a standard operating procedure to replicate this so if I give you future videos that you'll be able to do the exact same style and be extremely specific when I trigger this please awesome you can even create a skill to do that as well so it's very thing I might even say what I'd like you to do is create for me a skill for this that I can activate that will then repeat the process bam you basically just say that to it throw it in and then it will go ahead and do that for us and what I'll do guys also is I'll just copy this and I'll add this to the notion document so you can make it replicable also and just so you know where it is guys is right at the bottom of the page and also this is now complete so now it's increased it from 140 pixels to 200 so let's check it out and see what it looks like we've covered exactly how to leverage notebook airline and combine that with our tight gravity the next thing that we need and that's it and guys you can see just how freaking crazy this is now this is just the beginning because this now takes us very nicely onto the second level and so now we can edit any video we want to enhance the audio with a completely autonomous workflow that could do it for 100 videos without touching a single keyboard and we build more on these intelligent systems inside the school community so you can check that out if you like but here's an interesting thing we can do now is that we can give a website to this skill and effectively have it create for us any kind of video graphic animations which is exactly what we're going to do next and I'm going to tell you this which is really interesting is not only can it work effectively it can pull down any asset from that page okay we're include code now i want you to check this out guys you see it's 57% used the second you hit 50% I want you to do one thing and all that is is literally new window bam why because context rot after you reach 50% okay the first 50% is you and me in the morning it's 10:00 a.m got our coffees we're best at life second 50% is when it's like 11:50 we're starving we're tired we want to go to bed and we're not eating at 10 hours the point is you like refresh the browser you'll find the performance goes through the roof if you do that now check this out i'm going to give it a prompt like this well actually hold on a second should we write the prompt or should we just swing back over to this document here and just grab it from here which is the website to design system animation reotion showcase all we're going to do is give it a website URL so why don't we do it for glido https da uh bum bum glido.com what it's going to do is really interesting so we are going to analyze and extract the design system so typography colors icons logo layers and components we're going to create a animated motion showcase so in the dimensions that we want the frames per second we want the length we specify change this if you want to timeline storyboard intro typography color palette blah blah blah blah again this is more just showing what it could do what I'm going to do is actually remove this cuz we're not really going to do a storyboard like that animation style rules use spring light motion keep it minimal really cool and then I'm going to generate the files and then have the output so what we're going to do is literally just copy this right here let's come down and grab this and then we're going to head back over to um anti-gravity and then I'm going to say "Hey dude I want you to do for me a 15-second video just describing what the product does and I want you to sell Maui not the flights to Maui i want you to leverage the copy on the page and I also want you to pull down every single individual asset like the logos the logo of the brand and everything else to create it as per the below specifications." Cool and what's ironic here is we're using the tool to get the tool which is crazy i'm going to hit execute immediately and then Claude Co can start to build that for us in the background now for me when I'm looking at tools like remote what do I think you know in the AI space there's definitely hype for certain things and what I want to do in this channel is stay away from that like it's got to be actually functional and workable which is why every example I show in this video is how you can get production level output something that you would actually genuinely use and this stuff is really freaking cool if you follow these systems you can do it for anything and again if you're struggling on ideas let's come back up here all this stuff you can play around with this is like being a kid in a proverbial candy store looking at all this kind of stuff so I the way you should think now going forward when you want to do any editing or image or asset creation is can this be done programmatically with anti-gravity with these tools with remotion using cold code if it can it might make sense to build up a workflow and on that point we've also got all the to-dos now are being updated so it's downloading all the assets the logos the testimonials it is going to create the the theme designer showcase and then when it's done it's going to render the video to the desktop i just told it to put it on to desktop because that's where I grab my stuff but in theory it could be anywhere we could even have a fold on the left hand side whatever you sell the instructions it will follow that for you now the other cool thing about it being an anti-gravity is that we can use Gemini right and the Gemini model has access to Nana Banana we could also connect this to Nano Banana so we could generate literally like the best images generated for anything ever and incorporate that in our videos like it has the ability because when you connect anti-gravity and claude code to anything that's when its skills and potentials really go through the roof and so guys when it's complete look at the breakdown here scene one hero the glider logo it's got SFG the headline typography element two speed comparison blah blah blah blah well lots of interesting details let's freaking check it out let's open it up real quick which I have got open for us here so it's full screen and see what it made for us all right sweet five times fast in every app love it the speed difference is Look at that but that is freaking gorgeous speak naturally words appear instantly then we've got the logos and they're kind of got this nice soft float to them glad work speed of thought try Gladree blah blah blah how freaking cool is that now let's say that we had a client so Jack I don't like green i like blue well let's just actually come back over down to Gravity and say "Hey dude love it could you just change the green for a blue?" That would be kind of like similar to the green but the blue version of the green bam send that one off and we can make edits like this i could say "Make me three versions one blue one yellow one green and I'll decide." And you'll get three completely different versions all right guys so it's done it and it's opened up let's see what we've got okay the glide logo works five times faster it does indeed the speed difference is dramatic we got blue it changed it to blue that's freaking I mean I'm not surprised this is really freaking cool but it's just done this we just change colors or do anything there's anything about this aspect that we don't like we can change it and we build a system of rules to do that which is freaking amazing so for example I might say I love the design style with the green one what I want you to do is create a series of system instructions and a skill on the left hand side so that in the future when I give you a website I want you to reproduce the exact same thing that you did for me there boom now obviously I have given you the prompt but when we codify that as a skill you can basically crush it and it'll just do this whatever now we have a video editing skill for X and a video editing skill for Y so it's worth you thinking about what are all the asset creations animations video editing that I want to do codify them in skills and anti-gravity and then let it run rip and do all of it for you without touching a single button and so now you understand exactly how to edit any video do audio processing and you also know how to create bespoke animations and graphics that you would actually use and display the final step that we want to do here then is learn how to build animated dashboards or graphics for our websites for our AI apps that are actually connected to live data now this is going to absolutely blow your mind so let's start by heading back over to the notion document and we're going to go down to beautiful use case number three which is this gorgeous thing here so website styled interactive dashboard UI let's go and what I've basically said of this is do mock data first now let's look at the goal so build an interactive dashboard UI that matches the visual language of insert website URL we'll connect superbase later but for now design system extraction UI build and real interactivity and mock data deliver a functional responsive UI that looks like the website feels premium hover over active states skeletons models charts is architected for an easy superbase swap later superbase is kind of like Microsoft Excel that's been hitting the gym for a few years and it's where we're going to store all of our core data so for example we could store the number of subscribers we have or the number of GitHub stars that we have and we can now have these interactive beautiful dashboards anywhere on our websites on our apps that are connected to Superbase to our live data that has been designed and developed and animated by this skill and but the future is here now number one is extract the design system from the website typography colors components spacing and layout we could use the superbase MCP for this uh next one is to build a dashboard using extracted style core components match website exactly data table charts models interactive states and then mock data architecture that I provided for you down below again all you're doing is copy and pasting so let's come and do this copy it and head back over to anti-gravity and once we're here looks like we're 96% used so let's just click on that plus and start a fresh cool i'm going to come down here throw this one in here and we're going to give it the website which is going to be just do glido.com beautiful and we come down and hit enter and now that's complete we can check out this beautiful glider dashboard that it's built for us so let's give a look can we actually full screen this oh we can okay so let's hit play and see what we've got wow oh that is really cool look at that that's freaking sick so what I now want to do now I've got the component I like we can decide the things we want t uses revenue active now blah blah blah very cool let's actually just give it the following prompt which I think is going to be interesting so you'll know from our website design video so check this out we build gorgeous websites i mean look at this interactivity this will either be the video preceding this or it'll be the next one i'll let you see but if it's the next one you're really going to want to check out how I do this but you can see this gorgeous website right you hover over things we've got this wonderful thing that pops up um get a free critique on your website which is our lead magnet invest in ROI different growth packages by the way these testimonials are amazing because they go left to right they're gorgeous and when you scroll down we got this beautiful animation stop burning cash on bad websites freaking awesome then at the bottom you can also come down and create an account and just look at this interactive form i show you exactly how to build this but the point is let's say that on this website we wanted to talk about number of clients we work with well we can build an interactive dashboard like I've just shown you integrated onto this website for example and the second we get a new client we update that in Superbase and it reflects instantaneously it could be revenue it could be number of Instagram followers YouTube followers and we have these gorgeous dynamic dashboards now that are animated that we can sync with data do you see how crazy this is so if I come back over to anti-gravity I'm going to say yes make all the edits it's super cool when that's done we're going to have it on a web page and then we're going to connect it to Super so you can see exactly how you do this for any build you're doing for your own business or those of your clients beautiful so now we've got it i'm having a look at it and it's going left to right that's not kind of what I really wanted what I wanted to do is more rotate like three-dimensionally so let's give it that feedback and then let's also say that I want it to be interactive components if I were to hover over it it would like kind of change colors and stuff so let's go back to anti-gravity and we'll give it fun prompt hey dude sorry I didn't mean left to right i kind of want it to be like very small movements but almost like it's rotating on an axis like it's 3D so it doesn't go left to right it kind of like imagine like the right side seems a bit closer then the left side seems a bit closer but only small distinct movements after that I would like to then go ahead and embed this onto a HTML website for me beautiful i'm going to turn that one off and let my anti-gravity work its magic beautiful so now it's done it we've got this thing here we've got the logo we've got features and pricing and example thing if I scroll down and look at our dashboard guys you hover over things i love that neon glam so these numbers though are not really accurate we want to connect it now to Superbase so what I'm going to do is literally head straight back over now to anti-gravity and then we're going to give it the following prompt in anti-gravity hey there dude i want you to connect to Superbase via the Superbase MCP and what I'd like you to do is connect that with the numbers on the front end dashboard if those numbers don't exist simply create them for me in the Superbase MCP awesome and once you've entered in that prompt it'll then use your Superbase MCP to connect now the cool thing about anti-gravity is that easy to connect it together and the way you can grab any MCP you want to is you can head over to any language model so say for example look I've got all these code instances right but check this out i can very easily open up a new one by clicking this go and find me what the MCP config is what would it be blah blah blah whatever it is it will then grab it and then what we can do is head over to Superbase and grab our key which is awesome so yep configuration is fantastic and so the URL you go to guys is superbase.com/dashboard/account/tokens come down here to generate new token like so and we'll call this one Jack Roberts 654 all right and click on generate new token i'll just put this to expire within an hour for argument sake obviously as long as you'd like it's going to generate and you're going to copy then head straight back over to anti-gravity and then we can say something like "Hey dude I want you to connect with the Superbase MCP using the below token and save this to the clawed MCP file so that I may use this at any time in the future with all the clawed agents awesome come down and head that in." Wonderful and once you've added it in guys it will now add the Superbase MCP for you so you don't even need to think about the dashboard touch the dashboard dream about it it doesn't now you'll need to reset Claude to do this and you just say to Claude "Hey give me a prompt so that when I restart it I can pick up the conversation where I left." And all you do is just copy the prompt like that like so and then we're going to click up on both of these and then what we're going to do is shut down anti-gravity and just quit it then when we reload double click which is going to be cool like so and then again we're going to click on the Claw thing here and then once we've got Clawude open we just come back and we enter in the prompts which is cool and we'll just do the edit automatically for us please bam and then it should be ready to rock and roll once this is done we'll have your dynamic beautiful visual connected to a backend database and whenever that number changes your website will update for you automatically and this works with any component any style we could sit down here and tell it to change it to blue to change the numbers to change the design the layout the anything you could possibly want this is saying to base setup we're going to go for the Superbase MCP real quick that's fine let's submit that beautiful and then once it's connected to the MCP via Superbase it should now be a direct reflection so we've got the website we can see our graphics this is exactly what we built very cool we love this glow so if I head over to Superbase and you can find the table by on the left hand side coming down to table editor and you should see the table there and I've got values so let's just say that could be hey this is how much revenue we've generated for our clients or this is how many clients we've got so 100,000 what if it was 200 actually 250,000 awesome then if I come back over to the website here we should see this update now to 250,000 once I refresh the page i'm going to come down there and now the remy has become $250,000 now knowing how to build beautiful graphics is amazing but it won't ever let you reach your potential unless you know how to build beautiful user interfaces that aren't videogenerated and you can learn that by clicking on this video right
