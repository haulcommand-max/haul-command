## Predictive Permitting: Know Before You Commit

## The $2.3 Billion Problem

Every year, heavy-haul carriers and shippers lose an estimated **$2.3 billion** to:

| Problem | Annual Cost |
|---|---|
| Post-booking permit denials | $680M+ |
| Route failures (bridge strikes, clearance gaps) | $420M+ |
| Compliance fines & penalties | $350M+ |
| Detention time from permit delays | $520M+ |
| Escort & LE coordination failures | $330M+ |

### The Root Cause
Permits are ordered **AFTER** freight is accepted.

This means carriers commit to loads — and shippers commit to schedules — before anyone knows if the move is even *legally possible*.

**That is a billion-dollar blind spot.**

## The Kill Shot: Predictive Permitting

### What If You Knew Before You Committed?

Haul Command's AI Permit + Route Decision Engine delivers:

```
Carrier enters dimensions → Route viability → Permit probability → Risk score → Decision
```

| Metric | Before Haul Command | With Haul Command |
|---|---|---|
| Time to know if move is feasible | 3-7 days | **Under 60 seconds** |
| Data entry per permit | 15-25 fields + phone calls | **4 fields** (auto-filled) |
| Route clearance verification | Manual surveys ($2,000+) | **AI-scored instantly** |
| Multi-state compliance check | Call each state individually | **Automated, all states** |
| Bridge/tunnel clearance | Unknown until en route | **Pre-screened with 3D data** |

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Carrier Selects Vehicle
One click. All specifications auto-filled from stored profile.
No re-entering VIN, plate, dimensions, axle config — ever again.

### Step 2: Enter Load Weight + Destination
That's it. **4 total fields.**

### Step 3: Instant Feasibility Report

## ROI for Enterprise Shippers

### Scenario: 500 Oversize Loads Per Year

| Without Haul Command | With Haul Command |
|---|---|
| 15% post-booking cancellation rate | **<3% cancellation rate** |
| 75 loads cancelled = $3.75M lost revenue | **$750K saved in avoided cancellations** |
| 2,000 admin hours on permit paperwork | **200 hours (90% reduction)** |
| $500K in avoidable compliance fines | **$50K (90% reduction)** |
| 10+ bridge strike near-misses per year | **Zero (pre-screened)** |

### **Total Estimated Annual Savings: $1.2M — $2.5M**
### **Haul Command Annual Cost: $120K — $240K**
### **ROI: 5x — 20x**

## The Vision: From Permits to Infrastructure

Haul Command is not a permit service. We are **infrastructure**.

```
Phase 1 → Fastest Permit Engine        (Live now)
Phase 2 → Compliance Operating System  (Q3 2026)
Phase 3 → Route Intelligence Moat      (2027)
Phase 4 → Marketplace Control          (2028)
```

Every load that moves through our platform makes our data moat deeper:
- Bridge clearance intelligence improves
- DOT enforcement patterns sharpen
- Risk predictions become more accurate
- Competitors fall further behind
