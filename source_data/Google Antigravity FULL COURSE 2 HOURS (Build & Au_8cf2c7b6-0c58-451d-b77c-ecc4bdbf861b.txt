TITLE: Google Antigravity FULL COURSE 2 HOURS (Build & Automate Anything)
ID: 8cf2c7b6-0c58-451d-b77c-ecc4bdbf861b

google just dropped anti-gravity and it's insane this thing builds entire apps while you watch no coding needed just tell it what you want and AI agents do everything i'm talking landing pages automation tools full websites in minutes this is the future and I'm showing you everything and listen what I'm about to show you is probably the most powerful AI tool that's come out this year and most people have no idea it exists yet which means you're early really early and that matters because the people who learn this first are going to have a massive advantage over everyone else google just released something called anti-gravity and it's not like chat GPT it's not like Claude it's not even like the other AI coding tools you've heard of this is completely different this is Google's secret weapon powered by their Gemini 3 models and it doesn't just write code it builds entire projects autonomously like having a full development team working for you around the clock except it's AI agents and they don't sleep they don't take breaks they just build i'm talking full websites landing pages that actually convert automation systems that save you hours every single day custom apps tools dashboards everything and here's what makes this absolutely insane you don't need to know how to code not even a little bit you just tell it what you want in plain English like you're talking to a person and it builds the entire thing right in front of you with screenshots proving it works with tests to make sure nothing breaks with documentation explaining everything is like magic except it's real and it's available right now here's why you need to watch this entire course because I'm not just going to show you the basics I'm going to show you everything the stuff nobody else is talking about yet how to set it up properly so it actually works how how to use the different modes how to make the agents work together how to build complex projects step by step how to troubleshoot when things go wrong how to optimize for speed how to use the advanced features that multiply your results and most importantly I'm going to build real projects with you live on screen so you can see exactly how this works in the real world by the end of this course you're going to be able to build things you never thought possible without hiring anyone without learning to code without spending months trying to figure it out you're going to have a superpower and in a world where AI is moving this fast that superpower is going to separate you from everyone else who's still doing things the old way the slow way the expensive way let's go hey if we haven't met already I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates julian Goldie reads every comment so make sure you comment below so today I'm going to show you how to vibe code with anti-gravity so this is a free tool from Google that allows you to code with for example Claude or Gemini or all your other tools to build apps tools games websites pretty much anything that you can think of you can build anti-gravity and so what you can do is inside anti-gravity you can code out different things you want to so for example this was actually a quiz and then you can get the AI agent to test and code with you and you know this is changing how people build tools websites dashboards and automations and here's the crazy part you don't need to know how to code you don't need to hire developers you don't need to spend months learning technical stuff you just tell it what you want it plain English then multiple AI agents work together to build this stuff out for you so one agent will write the code another agent test it another agent fixes bugs and even take screenshots and videos to show you what they did so today I'm going to show you exactly how it works we're going to test it live right here we're going to build some tools together you can actually use inside your business things like lead trackers content dashboards client portals all built with AI and I'm going give you the exact prompts that we use plus a 30-day plan to go from zero to building your own business source even if you've never written a single line of code in your life this is brand new we're testing it live see what it can do let's get straight into it if you haven't used it before this is how it works if we say for example okay test this out and this is the quiz that we actually built out previously we're actually going to get the AI agent to now test out this quiz live and it will just click buttons and work on testing out this tool that it built in the background right so you can see it's just launching running the terminal commands hosting this locally etc and then locating this right and now it's launched the AI browser and it's going to navigate to the project that it's built offline so this is the tool that's built this is a quiz and it's actually going to use that quiz and start using it directly here again I'm not touching this i'm not messing around with this it's just going off and doing everything all right so if we hit confirm so it's actually going to start analyzing the page start videoing the screen and then using this to test it out all right so today what I'm going to show you is the Goldie Gravity Launch Framework and this is my favorite and personal framework for building business automation tools with AI agents here's why it works most people think building apps takes months they think you need developers they think you need to understand programming none of that is true anymore right with Google Anraity you become architect right so you tell AI agents what to build they do the heavy lifting and you just guide them and approve their work and this framework has five phases so liftoff so days 1 7 you're going to get the tools set up and learn the basics days 8 to 14 this is a 30-day plan you're going to learn how to build first your simple tools right phase three days 15 to 21 you create more complex business tools phase 4 days 22 to 28 you test and refine and then phase five is like scaling right so days 29 to 30 you want to deploy and use this inside your actual business all right so example let me show you how this works these are some real tools I actually want for my own business for example for the AR profit boardroom I want like a member progress dashboard right a tool that shows new members what to do first it tracks their progress through the community shows leaderboards and achievements all right so what I can do is I can go into Antiggravity we can open up a new window which will open up a new project we'll click on open folder we'll type in member dashboard we're going to close this other one over here and then we're going to go back to antigravity open up that folder for the dashboard as you can see and what you can see here inside anti-gravity is you have over here your project files over here you have the actual code and then over here you have the chat right and this is really where you're going to interact with stuff inside the chat you can switch between planning and fast mode i'm going to go with fast mode and then we're going to type this in right now you want to give it a bit of context about you your business etc so I'm going to say okay create a dashboard for this but do it for the AI profit boardroom community right and then what we can actually do is go to the AI profit boardroom grab some information about it etc right so we can take this information like so plug that into anti-gravity here's some info about it right and it can be messy inside the prompt it doesn't really matter and then what we're going to do is say okay build this then we're going to hit enter and what this will do is start figuring out okay what are the dashboard elements how do we integrate the gamification of it how do we begin the project setup right and it's going to run some terminal commands but if you've got your settings enabled so that it runs terminal commands for you without you approving them you're going to save a lot of time so you can see here inside the settings of the agent we have for example like terminal command auto we have allow terminal commands etc right and that just saves a lot of time and then you know that will just automate a lot of the prompting that sort of thing if you're not sure about this stuff you don't have to allow it it's just this saves me time and that's what I'm going to allow and the same for the browser agent as well we've got a bunch of approved websites we've got the settings for it over here and then we're just going to X off that and you can see that's now beginning to build this out right so it's actually created did images with Nana Banana Pro and then it's going to build out the HTML for our project so that we can test it out by the way source sporters you're asking about like how to start your social media from scratch right so what I'd recommend is if you go to the AI prof here and then you go to the YouTube AI road map it will show you how to build a YouTube channel from scratch based on what's worked for me right also if you want to learn how to for example automate your X account from scratch you can get that inside this section and the same for like shorts and all our other social media channels we show you exactly how to automate all of that stuff using the board teachings in the classroom inside there so that's the best place to learn that stuff so we can see that's now beginning to build out the dashboard here and now we've got a dashboard as we requested right now this is going to test out first check it's okay etc but you can see how easy that was to build right and we've generated the dashboard here we can actually stop this so we can stop the agent force it to close etc and then we can switch between the pages and that sort of thing all right so let's close that now have a look through yeah all right so it's built out the dashboard like so that's how you can build out a really quick dashboard again some of those pages didn't work so you just want to make sure you continue to code out or the AI agent will test it and continue to code out but that's basically how it works right you could also for example create a live caller all right so we could take that we can go to anti-gravity and we can say okay delete everything but now create a live calluler for the AR profit order all right we'll stop the agent over here and we just tell it to start again and build this cool schedule for her right now I wouldn't recommend starting again but it's just because I'm showing this live for you and I want to demonstrate like how easy it is to vibe code stuff out right you can also for example take screenshots and then upload them inside the chat here so if you click on plus you can add images you can do mentions you can actually mention workflows as well which is pretty cool so if you go to workflows here you can set up workflows and then you can see it's now beginning to code out the new version of the tool that we were building out so I've actually got a 30-day Goldie gravity launcher plan right and this shows you exactly what to do each day every day as a tool to use in a prompt to try right so for example like in the liftoff phase days one to seven the setup and the basics i've broken down exactly what to do every single day if you really want to master anti-gravity this is inside the AI success lab and it's completely free but you can get like a 30-day plan on exactly how to implement this stuff for you so it will show you how to for example like test out Gemini Pro and by the way this is the newly coded live calluler so this is the AI agent testing it out now and you can see that it's clicking through the pages seeing what to do etc it's actually built in some ways that we could sync Google and everything else and you can sync it to your calendar now and then it also has a link to the Zoom room now that calendar itself looks really nice right like the design itself looks super nice it's built into the actual dashboard we created before and you can see it's now beginning to schedule in the tools and everything else right if you ever want to take over the AI you can but you can see here for example it's got these are the upcoming calls this week right and then it's got the sync options plus we can download the calendar and we've just live coded a calendar app in the space of 2 minutes whilst I've been talking to you right and you can also for example enable email reminders or browser notifications etc inside this it's got a live soon section which looks super nice and the whole looks great right and that was coded out using Google Gemini flash now you can switch between these so you could use for example like quartic 4.5 opus you could use Gemini three three pro low and high but actually to be honest like Gemini Flash is great because it's fast it doesn't seem to hit the limit so much and it's super quick to use and build out but you can see how powerful this is you can vibe code almost anything that you can think of and the only limitation is really your creativity or figuring out like the best business cases to use it so this is the 30-day plan what I've actually done as well is inside the notes from today I've added 100 different prompts for solarreneurs so these are like prompts you can copy and paste directly into tactic gravity and they customize your business so you can see all these lead generation tools that you could build client management tools etc content management tools you got productivity tools right all this cooler stuff right so for example here we can say okay build a to-do list app with add complete and delete functions sort by priority right so we could go back to anti-gravity now we can open up a new window means a new folder and a new project and we'll type in to-do list tab right we'll hit open so we're going to X off the old project we're going to go into the new project we can actually switch into planning first which will create better outputs right so if you use a planning function instead you will get better outputs it's going to start planning the to-do list for the to-do list app which we'll come back to in a second but yeah it's pretty amazing what you can do here now what I want to show you is I want to share some truths that might surprise you so some people say that building apps takes months of coding the right belief instead is that AI agents build apps in minutes right so for example Thomas Edison he tried over a thousand times to make the light bulb work in each try took weeks or months of careful work today we flip a switch and we have a light instantly and the same shift is happening with building tools right what used to take a team of developers months now takes one person with the right prompts minutes and Edison didn't give up because the technology kept improving you shouldn't give up on building tools because the technology has finally arrived google Anti-gravity is basically the light switch moment for app building some people say I'm not technical enough this is the to-do list app by the way that's just opened in the background right you just need to describe what you want so for example like Richard Branson he always struggled with reading and writing his whole life but he built hundreds of companies and he didn't do it by being the smartest person in the room he did it by describing his vision clearly to others who could execute google gravity works the same way so you don't need to understand code you need to describe what you want clearly the AI agents are your technical team your job is to be the visionary for example Branson would love this technology right he's a visionary other people will say AI tools are just hype the right belief here is that a fundamental shift in how things are getting built has changed with anti-gravity if you look at Walt Disney for example he was told no by everyone and they all said his dream of a theme park was a fantasy it would never work but Disney saw something they couldn't see he saw a future where families would pay to experience magic and AI tools today face similar doubt some people say it's just autocomplete some people say it can't do real work and some people say it will never replace developers but the people using these tools right now they're building businesses faster than before they're creating tools that competitors can't even imagine and Disney didn't let doubt stop him so don't let doubt stop you from exploring what's possible so if we go back to the tool now we've got the to-do list so let's test this out okay so we're going to say check out anti-gravity as a to-do list we'll select high priority and low hit add task boom does it work yes does it look nice yes did it work first time around yes did we code it for free with anti-gravity yes my friends all right and we've done the same with all of these tools and apps that we built today all right so you can create amazing stuff with this you can create magic with this if you know what you're doing so thanks so much for watching if you want to get all the video notes from today that is exactly how to vibe code with anti-gravity you can basically vibe code anything you want and inside the AI success lab which comes with a community of 40,000 members it's completely free you can post in the community you can connect with 40,000 people inside the classroom here you will get access to all this cool stuff and if you go inside the December section here you can see all the notes from today with the prompts the tools the tips the framework right so this is the Goldie Gravity launch framework you've got for example the build ideas that we actually built you've got all the prompts from today as well and you have the 30-day road map plus all the beliefs that we've talked about as well right so it's basically a full guide a full very in-depth guide on exactly how to use anti-gravity it talks about the wrong beliefs the right beliefs and how to overcome them right to get results with this stuff now if you're wondering okay do people actually get results that people actually build stuff with this you can actually check out the air profit boardroom and we have over 108 pages of fromos inside the air profit boardroom all right so for example Elsa she said "Wow this community is next level." Right mike said "Julian your content is amazing." Right eric said "Programmed a WordPress plugin with Manis." Steven said he'd never heard of NM before and now we built something that actually saved him 10% of his time right it's freed up 10% of his time using the automations from the AirPod andrew got his first win by creating his first AI avatar video you've got Omelle said like how good the week one lesson is for AI agents and there's so many people getting results with this stuff darren as well he said "Wow that's so exciting." It's a credit for you to all your wonderful training support it's a credit to this community who share congratulations and so we got 108 pages of stuff like this all these different testimonials as you can see it's pretty much an endless scroll at this point i don't think I've even had the chance to read them all but the main thing to note here is if you want to join a community of winners if you want to see what people are building with this stuff if you want to connect with some of the best AI automators in the world join the AI profit board because inside the community you get the accountability group you can post you can ask questions you can share your wins you can share your goals you can read the value post you can get the weekly updates right and also inside the classroom here you get all of my best trainings on AI automation so for example we show you how to get results with AI and go from beginner to expert in just 6 weeks right and we show you how to build your first air agent in under five minutes on top of that we show you our playbook right and this is our playbook for automating Twitter newsletters shorts AI avatar videos screen shares automating videos with AI etc right we have training on for example lead generation social media NA10 templates agency courses we've got stuff on how to get clients AI automation YouTube etc all this cool stuff and then also if you need help in real time you want to jump on a call with someone you can actually jump on four weekly coaching calls as you can see right here so you can jump on these coaching calls get help support whenever you need it and get your questions answered in real time and if you can't make the coaching calls no problem at all you can watch them back inside the call recording section here so amazing community feel free to check that out that is at the AI profit board link in the description or you can go to a profitboarding.com google just dropped something wild it's called anti-gravity and when you combine it with clawed code is like having an entire dev team working for you i'm talking planning coding testing all done by AI agents while you watch this is the craziest AI coding combo I've seen and I'm about to show you exactly how it works let's dive in all right so here's what's happening right now in the AI coding world google just launched something called Anti-Gravity on November 18th 2025 it's not just another code editor is a full AI agent IDE that uses their new Gemini 3 Pro model to actually plan execute and validate code for you think of it like this instead of you writing every line of code you have AI agents that work semi-autonomously across your entire project they can access your editor your terminal even an integrated browser and here's where it gets insane when you combine anti-gravity with Claude Code which runs on Anthropics Claude Opus 4.5 you get the best of both worlds gemini handles the planning and orchestration claude handles the actual code execution and generation it's like having a project manager and a senior developer working together except they're both AI anti-gravity is Google's new agent first IDE instead of just giving code suggestions it runs autonomous agents that complete entire tasks these agents create task lists take screenshots and work while you do other things it supports Windows Mac OS and Linux claude Code is Anthropic's coding environment you access through your terminal it generates code debugs problems and creates entire project structures the latest version runs on Claude Opus 4.5 and it's incredibly good at coding tasks why combine them because each one covers the other's weaknesses anti-gravity is amazing at planning and coordinating clawed Code is better at actually writing complex code with fewer bugs the hybrid workflow use Gemini for planning Claude Code for execution anti-gravity for testing let me show you what this looks like in practice let's say I want to build a new landing page for the AI profit boardroom i want it to convert visitors show the amazing value of AI automation and explain all the benefits of our community to get more customers leads and traffic here's how I'd use this combo first I open anti-gravity and give it the highle task i tell it create a landing page for AI profit boardroom that focuses on conversion highlights community benefits and uses modern design principles anti-gravity's Gemini agent breaks this down into a task list it says create file structure design hero section build features list add testimonial section create CTA buttons set up responsive styling test on multiple devices that's the planning phase done in seconds now here's where it gets interesting right for each of those tasks I can choose which tool executes it for the file structure and basic setup I use clawed code i open my terminal run clawed code and paste the requirements it creates all the HTML CSS and JavaScript files i need clean structure proper naming conventions everything organized this happens in about 30 seconds then I switch back to anti-gravity for the visual design work i tell its agent to design the hero section with specific elements headline about AI automation sub headline about the community background gradient CTA button the agent uses Gemini to generate the design creates a preview and even takes a screenshot so I can see it without switching windows if I don't like something I tell it to adjust the agent iterates until it's right for the features section I go back to clawed code because I want custom JavaScript interactions i describe what I want a features grid that animates on scroll highlights different benefits and links to specific resources claude code writes the entire thing including the animation logic and responsive breakpoints it even adds comments explaining what each part does back to anti-gravity for testing its browser agent loads the page tests it on different screen sizes checks that all links work and validates the HTML it creates a report showing what works and what needs fixing i can see screenshots of every test this is where anti-gravity really shines because it automates all the tedious testing work now let me tell you the benefits people are seeing first you extend your usage limits by switching between tools strategically you get more done before hitting walls second reliability goes up clawed code produces fewer bugs and cleaner code third it feels like having a whole dev team one tool plans one codes one tests token limits are another thing both tools use tokens for their AI models complex projects burn through tokens fast you need to be strategic about what you ask each tool to do don't ask for explanations you don't need don't regenerate code that already works be efficient with your prompts model inconsistency happens sometimes gemini might suggest one approach and Claude might implement it differently usually this isn't a problem but occasionally you get friction the way to handle this is to be very specific in your prompts tell Clar code exactly what anti-gravity planned don't leave room for interpretation here's what I recommend for your workflow use anti-gravity for planning and project management let it break down your tasks create timelines organize your work use clawed code for actual code generation especially complex logic or algorithms use anti-gravity's agents for testing validation and documentation this division of labor maximizes what each tool is good at you can also integrate other tools into this workflow there are MCP servers that add extra capabilities for example test sprite MCP helps with automated testing sonotype MCP helps with dependency security you plug these into anti-gravity and suddenly your AI dev stack has even more power now is this the future of coding i think it's a big step in that direction we're moving from AI that suggests code to AI that actually builds complete features the role of the developer is shifting you're becoming more of a director and less of a typist you define what you want you orchestrate the tools you validate the output the AI does the implementation work this matters because it changes what's possible projects that used to take weeks can now take days features that used to require a whole team can be built by one person with the right AI tools the barrier to building software is dropping fast here's what you should do next if you're a developer try this combo set up anti-gravity get access to clawed code and build something real don't just test it with toy projects build an actual tool or feature you need that's when you'll see the real power pay attention to which tool you use for what tasks develop your own workflow patterns share what you learned with the community because this is all so new that best practices are still emerging if you're not a developer but you run a business understand that this technology is going to change how fast and cheap it is to build software your competitors might already be using tools like this to ship features faster you need to either adopt these tools or hire people who know how to use them and here's something cool you don't need to be an expert coder to use this effectively if you understand what you want to build and can describe it clearly these AI tools can handle a lot of the technical complexity that making software development more accessible before we wrap up I want to mention two things that can help you even more with AI automation first if you want to learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like anti-gravity and clawed code check out the AI profit boardroom we dive deep into practical AI automation that actually works for real businesses you'll see exactly how to implement these tools to get more customers leads and traffic and if you want the full process SLPs and over a 100 AI use cases like this one join the AI Success Lab it's our free AI community links are in the comments and description you'll get all the video notes from there plus access to our community of 40,000 members who are crushing it with AI real people real results real help today I'm going to be running through exactly how to use Google Antigravity if you've never used anti-gravity basically it's a free way to code with Google and you can also get access to Claude as well and it's completely free you can code locally with this you can build some amazing stuff with this and you can download it at anti-gravity.goole once you're in you're going to be able to build stuff like this as you can see and I'll show you for example how to use this to build apps tools websites landing pages almost anything that you want and how to master it it's very easy because literally you just type in same simple English exactly what you want and you can get started straight away and today what you're going to learn is how to set up anti-gravity from scratch how to build your first app with one sentence how to use screenshots to make changes how to watch your app get built in real time the exact settings you need to switch on and yes this is free right now cuz it's in public preview all right so we're going to test out today we're going to use the anti-gravity acceleration system and this is my simple framework for turning Google Antigravity into a customer getting machine for your business right and most people would download this tool and make a calculator an app or a to-do list and that's fun but it's not going to help you so much right with lead generation that sort of thing if instead you could build like a lead capture landing page for your website or a quiz that qualifies potential customers or a tool that shows off your expertise or a dashboard that makes you look professional that's what separates those who tinker with those who build real businesses all right so let me talk you through exactly how we're going to use this right first thing you want to do is just download this from anti-gravity all the links and notes from today are inside the AI success lab link in the comments description completely free community as you can see right here with 40,700 members and if you go inside the classroom here you go to December 2025 and then from here you can see that we've got all the video notes from today and we're going to work through this 30-day anti-gravity mastery plan as you can see and we'll just run through exactly how to use it so first thing you're going to do is download the version open up like you can see I've done over here and we're going to get straight into this so understand the two views here right so you got two views so you got over here you got the builder and you can switch between planning and fast mode so you can choose your AI agents and then over here you can choose the actual API that you're using to build and code with right now sometimes if you're using the free version you're going to hit limits so how do you overcome those you can switch between different APIs so if you hit the limits on one you switch to the next if you want to plan out your project before you build it you select planning if you want to build out the project and actually code you have to select fast over here and then you just type in what you want in this section now on the left hand side you will see the project files as you can see and that's basically how it works all right so what we're going to do over here is we are going to just start with something simple so we're going to say okay create a simple landing page with headline three benefits the email signup form right so copy this and all the instructions are inside this section so this is for building your first real project now first thing you want to do is load up a new folder okay so open up the folder as you can see and you just want to load up a new folder right the reason for that is cuz you're starting a new project from scratch like you can see now what we're going to do is we're going to type in create a simple landing page with a headline three benefits email signup form this is going to be a really simple fast project as you can see we're going to select Gemini Flash this will help you code out your first landing page with anti-gravity if you're just learning how to use this by the way I can see some people in the chat are asking for the link to the air profit boarding if you just type in air profit boarding on chat GPT or Google or you go to the air profitboarding.com you can get the link for it there if you watch it on YouTube you can actually get access i saw someone else as well is asking how to watch this back so if you want to watch back the full live stream you can get it inside the live section of my YouTube channel so you can see live stream right there and then someone else was asking like how to build for example uh personal tutor and I'll come on to that in a minute right so what you can see here is that the AI is now open up the landing page i'm not touching this AI agent right and it's beginning to check out the landing page the optin form etc now this is very basic the design and everything else super basic but that's the whole point right we're just trying to create something really simple and easy to use so if we go back here you can see it's now checking out testing out etc right and I'm going to stop it there right just to show you how easy and simple that is now let's say for example you wanted to create a personal tutor maybe you wanted to create a personal tutor for something like learning I don't know learning Thai right what we can do here is we can open up a new folder all right so we'll open up a folder here and say personal tutor for Spanish right we'll open that up as you can see and then from here we can say okay build a personal tutor tool for learning Spanish right i'll go with Spanish cuz it's probably easier for the AI to teach Spanish to the type right and basically what it's going to do is start building out this app as you can see now again if you were trying to spend a bit more time and care over this then you would use the planning mode first inside the drop down but I just want to go straight into fast so we're not messing around here and we're getting straight into it and you're getting as much value as possible some people are asking like is this better than other tools anti-gravity is really good because you can code locally come back to the project and it's free right and it's also good for building out bigger projects so for example if you're using AI Studio you can build out like one landing page one mini app etc but if you want to build out something bigger than that you can build out bigger projects cuz you got the files on the left hand side and these are saved locally i would say that this is better for building out bigger projects but if you want to create something fast and small then you can use something like AI Studio so it depends really how big the project is so this is beginning to build out as you can see it's t the CSS the HTML etc it's going to test out in a second whilst we're waiting for that to load let's come back to this right so inside here as well what you can actually do is you can change some of the settings inside anti-gravity as well so if you go to antigravity here we go to antigravity settings this is the app that we built by the way the Spanish app but if we go back to the settings inside antigravity you can see here we can decide whether we want to review stuff where we want it in secure mode whether we want to auto command etc this will if you auto command basically it will never ask for confirmation before it starts testing stuff out so it depends and then also you got options for auto continue and auto fix stuff right so if you flick those on it's just going to automate a lot more of the process you can also enable web tools or disable them depending on whether you want the AI to be able to access the web and that's basically how it goes and the same for the browser right so for example you can check out the browser it can test stuff out in the browser and then it's got a bunch of whitelisted pages right there as well so let's X off that and we've got the tool being tested out over here so it says "Ola I am Carlos your Spanish teacher how can I help you learn today?" And then the AI is typing in Ola and it's testing this out right and then you can see at the top here it's beginning i don't think this will be fully built out but you've got different options at the top for example the dashboard you got the lessons you got the stuff to practice and then the tutor as well and you can see how the AI has actually responded to us right so we put in Ola it said "Hola so how are you today a bit of Spanish that you learned today at least you learned something." The AI is talking with the other AI the personal tutor to learn Spanish right some people ask does this access local files yes so this is all local stuff so we actually right click this for example click on reveal and finder you can see that we've got all of these files stored locally and you can store and open folders locally inside this IDE to edit things all right so this is working nicely i say can you teach me Spanish can you say that in a full sentence blah blah blah we got the practice section here so these are like flashcards with audio right obviously ola means hello and we flip it over it's pretty nice like this it looks better than other learning apps i'm not going to mention which ones but it looks better than some of the ones gracia thank you how are you all right like all the bill please okay and then mana which is tomorrow all right flip over tomorrow boom i'm too good at Spanish too good mate too good it's too easy once you know Italian you can speak Spanish pretty fast especially when it's as simple as that then we got the classroom here for tutoring people we also have the dashboard here right and this is all personalized to me right it's not personalized to other people was personalized to me cuz these are the words I've learned and everything else right and so obviously this is not 100% ready to go you want to test it you want to try it out you want to make sure it actually works but have we created a bigger like a five-page website with flashcards mini apps a tutor that speaks to us etc absolutely pretty amazing right and so you can just keep tweaking that it's not going to be 100% ready to go but it is going to be pretty good all right let's keep going through now once you've done that what you can actually do is look at your app in the browser preview and the AI agent will take screenshots of it and test it out for you so the anti-gravity browser control actually previews and tests it out my app as you saw before we deployed it right so if there are any errors as the AI agent is testing it will actually auto those before we find the problems which saves a lot of time and you can see here the anti-gravity browser control says the agent can click scroll type and navigate web pages automatically whilst working it displays an overlay showing it progress in price controls to stop if you need to intervene right and then it's given us a bunch of use cases iterating on website designs quality assurance testing monitoring dashboards automating routine tasks right which is great cuz now you don't have to mess around with like terminal commands or anything like that now what I'd recommend from here we've already built a simple landing page but now we can build something much better right so we could actually say okay and these are examples from the AI success lab so all the notes are here you say "Okay build a landing page from SEO agency include a headline about getting more traffic from Google three bullet points about benefits testimonial section and an email signup form just to test it out right we're not actually going to launch this but we can test it out." And so here I'm just going to open up a new folder again test site let's open this up all right and you can see here now we've just got the blank files right and what we're going to do is type in this prompt as we mentioned before and again that's just going to start building it out for us right so it's really beginning to build this stuff out for us step by step someone asked is new folder new project so it's the same project but what I've done is actually just open a folder and replace the old files right if you wanted a new project with a new folder you would go to new window here and then you can create a new project right so if you open up a folder this is going to replace whatever's inside your existing window everything that you code though will be stored locally inside the folder that you were previously editing so now it's beginning to code that out as you can see it's pretty fast it's actually amazing how fast it is and we've got the page like so with all the information on it and it's beginning to coder right and so it's got those testimonials a bit more complex than what we built before i still prefer the personal tutor and now you can see the agent needs the input so if we click on return to agent we can go back to anti-gravity and you see here it's like asking us to confirm something before we test it out all right so if we click on confirm it's going to take some screenshots of the page right to fix or identify or correct any visual issues and there you go all right now we're going to stop that agent but that's basically a simple example and then you can just keep making it better keep improving it you might say for example add more spacing make the headline bigger add a subtle gradient make the buttons more clickable etc and this back and forth is how you really define your design and then from there just build a quiz interface for example and this is something else we could do so for example we say create a five question quiz that helps business owners find out if they need help with marketing each question should have four multiple choice answers at the end show a results page based on the score make it look clean and professional so we'll go back to anti-gravity you know the drill now open up a new folder type in the quiz open up and you can see we've built out so many different projects but we've not hit a limit on the tokens right how amazing is that and we're using one of the best technologies in the world for coding this out which is Google Flash one of the best tools that I've ever used when it comes to AI it comes up with some pop-ups at the bottom and you just click okay or don't show again etc and it will just start rerunning this now and so we've got a full 30-day plan on all this stuff you can build out you can have like multiple agents running you can use the browser recording etc but you've basically seen how to build out three different projects using this right so quizzes websites landing pages personal cheaters whatever you want whatever websites you can build you can do this with anti-gravity and this stuff looks really cool check this out this basic landing page we built this is the full tutor that we built as well so you can see for the SEO agency now if you go back here it's still editing and coding out the next project but before we come on to that let me talk about what you've done so once you've got through that 30-day plan that I've given you in 30 days you just went from like zero to building out our apps with anti-gravity and I would just say with your progress just say okay based on what I've built so far what should I learn next to take my skills further now I actually give you a bunch of ideas and I would recommend posting your progress inside the AR profit boarding just so that you can share your wins and grow with the community because when you share stuff and you hold yourself accountable like our daily accountability group inside the air profit boarding you're going to learn faster you're going to get better results you're going to hold yourself accountable and you're going to really just enjoy the process as well all right now some people going to say I'm not technical enough for doing this and the right belief oh we've got the quiz here so I'll come on to that in a second i'm glad it's done that so also what I like about this is like when I'm just letting it run in the background it will actually open up the tab and test it when it's ready to go right so you can see here it's selecting the quiz again I'm not clicking anything or anything like that it's just messing around with the quiz giving us some ideas testing it out and then it will actually and you see here all right we're just going to click confirm on that and then it's going to test it out right so it's just testing out all the questions making sure the quiz works and then it will come on to this in a minute right and so it's built out this quiz as well and again like the clean it looks nice but if there are any bugs it's going to find them and it's going to fix them if they're super obvious so now it's reopened the quiz and if the agent's using it cuz you can see like the blue background i'm actually going to stop the agent for now cuz I just want to explain some stuff to you you see that was very quick to build out right so the wrong belief is I'm not technical enough for this the right belief is you just need to describe what you want right so let me tell you about the fisherman and the smart net there was a fisherman who caught fish the old way for 20 years one day someone showed him a net that could find fish on its own i don't understand how it works he said "You don't need to." They replied "You just tell it where you want fish right?" And he tried it first day he caught more than a whole week of the old way right he never learned how the networks he just learned how to use it and Google anti-gravity is that net you don't need to understand code you just need to know what you want also some people are going to say these free tools they never actually work but the thing is Google actually built this with the most advanced AI ever google built this the same Google that runs YouTube Gmail and the biggest search engine in the world this uses Gemini 3 the most advanced AI and yes it's free during the preview is it perfect no still buggy places but it works well enough to build real apps and it's only going to get better all right other people will say I've tried coding before and failed right and I would say the right belief is you failed at the old way of coding you didn't fail at coding no one failed at coding you failed at the old way of coding the way where you have to memorize syntax where one missing comma broke everything where you spent hours hunting for bugs that's not what this is this is typing make this look better and what should happen this is dragging a screenshot and saying fix this you've probably had conversations with chat GBT before did that feel like coding no neither does this you also might say I need to be a developer to use this stuff and that's wrong you just need to describe what you want here's a quick test can you describe what you want if you can say I want a page where people enter their email and get a free guide if you can say that sentence you can use this tool that's the only skill required being able to describe what you want and the AI handles everything else right other people say "This is probably just hype." But we've tested it live right now we've built tools we built landing pages we built forms we built personal tutors we built quizzes we've tested it live right now you've watched me use it in real time and if it didn't work you'd see it today if it didn't work you'd know but there were no editing or fancy cuts in this no pre-recorded stuff in this it was just raw live testing wasn't it other people would say "My business is different this won't work for me every business needs the same core tools right so every business really needs a way to capture leads a way to show what you do a way to look professional a way to answer common questions and every business every niche every industry needs that right so whether you sell consulting or products or services you need these things and this tool can build all of them other people will say well it's too buggy to use right now and I would say the bugs are part of learning early right yes it's a bit buggy the browser recording feature doesn't always work perfectly sometimes generations take a while sometimes you need to try a prompt a few times but here's the thing every early version of every great tool was buggy the people who waited for perfect got left behind don't get left behind some people say I should wait until it's more stable and I think the best time to learn is when it's new here's something interesting about early adopters right they don't for perfect so by the time the stable version comes out early adopters have already built their systems they already know the shortcuts they already have results and the waiting crowd starts from zero the early are already at the finish line right so let's answer some of these questions inside the Q&A all right let's see what we got here is that a onepage website or three-page website is it not an app because I heard you can't SEO an app yeah so it was just a four page website right with the dashboard the flashcards the quizzes and everything else can it use MCP or does it need MCP i think you can use MCP but I've never tested out i'm sure you could get that to work do you need the Gemini Pro plan for using anti-gravity no you don't you can use it for free today it's so easy to code right and then Gemini I promised it was me that failed due to coding which I really respect that attitude right it's like I always blame myself as well if something doesn't work it's not the tools fault it's my fault for not being good enough right and if I just get better then I'll be better at using these tools and I'll get better results so I really respect that Mark shout out to you for really taking accountability there all right so thanks for watching if you want to get all the videos from today it's inside the AI success lab link in the comments description this connects you with 40,700 members as you can see inside the community we have all these awesome trainings lots of people introduce themselves very active community you get access to the video notes inside the December 2025 section so just go down here and you can scroll down and then get access to all this stuff if you want to connect with me personally you can join the AI profit boardroom inside there you can DM me personally you can connect with 1,900 AI builders you can post inside the community share your wins and get feedback inside here because what's great about this is you can share your wins you can ask questions if you ever get stuck you can get all this stuff right here all right mark says "If it fails we learn to repair more effectively." That's it if it fails I get better at fixing stuff right let's focus on solutions not problems and that's I think that's the best mindset you can have when building with AI automation you can see here like loads of people posting stuff and then also inside the classroom we have four coaching calls per week these are live coaching calls you can jump on we actually have a coaching call later today if you want to jump on it and then inside the classroom here as well you get access to the six week AI automation master class that shows you how to go from like complete beginner to really mastering AI and really learning this stuff also you'll get access to the playbook with all of my best automations from like how to automate your emails Twitter newsletter shorts AI avatar videos you probably see a lot of my AI avatar videos popping up on whatever social media channel you watch me on and then also you'll get access to the latest SAP updates from each month you'll get access to lead generation and social media automations plug-andplay the NA10 templates and workflows my agency course Q&A call recordings you can watch back from the coaching course the AICO automation section and also the YouTube AI 6E road map so everything that you need to really win with AI is inside the AR profit boardroom it's got an amazing I think what really makes it just being part of something with such great people right like the characters and the personalities and the people that I've connected with inside the air profit boardroom are just absolutely amazing yeah absolutely loving it casra I was waiting for the coaching call with Santa yesterday hopefully Santa showed up mate i saw that you got a banana for Christmas that's really Craig Campbell to get you one of those rap bananas good for you mate and Mark says he might have been busy we're about to test something that just dropped from Google it's called anti-gravity and here's why you need to pay attention so this is a free tool that builds real apps real tools real systems just by typing what you want in plain English no code no developers no tech skills needed and I'm going to test this live with you today we're going to see exactly how it works does it actually deliver can someone with zero coding knowledge really build business tools in minutes and here's what we're going to do together all right all of this using just words no code and if this works the way Google says it does this changes everything for entrepreneurs who want to automate their business before they needed to hire developers first so let's test exactly how to use it you can download it for free right here and then once you've done that you're going to see something that looks like this right so this is anti-gravity as you can see and from here we can start building with this all right if you've never used this before basically you've got your files on the left hand side and then over on the right hand side you can chat with the AI right i'm going to be using Gemini Flash because that's the fastest one we can switch between planning or fast but I'm just going to go straight with fast cuz I'm coding with you in real time and then from here we can start building this out now if you never used this before let me show you some examples of what you can actually build with this right so if we take this prompt and all these are inside AI success lab link in the comments description if you want to get the video notes from today we say build an invoice generator with PDF export right simple as that very simple command but basically we can build a custom app a mini app using this process so now you see it's beginning to code out and it's pretty simple and easy to use this all right so it's running the terminal command and again this is free this is hosting locally that's one of the other big benefits here is you're coding locally so number one you can store files and you can build bigger projects offline using this and number two you can use it for free and number three it's more private than creating that content online because you're hosting it locally the only thing you got to remember is that you're using Google's APIs which means that's still on someone else's server right it's not on yours you're not using O Lama or something like that locally to build this so now it's beginning to code this out as you can see creating the directory structure and we can come back to that in a minute we can actually code out in multiple windows here we can use this for free up to certain limits and you can see here that I can actually build a project without hitting the limits as you can see inside the chat here so it's beginning to code this out it's creating the JSON here and I don't code i don't understand code i can't use HTML but I can quickly build out the tools I want just by typing in exactly what I want as you can see here so all we said was build an invoice generator with PDF system all right so it's beginning to code that out now let me talk to you about why this matters all right so you know the old way of building business tools is that you would have an idea for a tool that would save you time you search for existing apps and nothing fits perfectly you try to learn coding but pretty much give up after a week you hire a developer and wait weeks for delivery the tool doesn't work how you imagined you go back and forth with a revision you end up doing everything manually anyway and you feel a bit stuck and frustrated that was the old way now the new way if you're building with anti-gravity is like you have an idea for a tool you describe it in plain English anti-gravity builds it whilst you watch you test it immediately you tweak it by just saying what you want to change you have a working tool in minutes you move on to the next thing and you feel like you have superpowers right that's exactly how this works step by step and so as you can see here it's beginning to build this bad boy out and we're just going to wait for the coding to finish it should only take a few minutes it seems to be working already so you see here it's actually hosted on a local network URL and let's see if we can pull this up yeah so this is opening up the Agent browser but I can actually preview it on the local host here all right so that's a URL to see it and then you can see we've got a working tool boom we can actually see the AI testing the tool in real time and moving around i'm not touching this i'm touching anything on the screen the AI is actually looking at the screen typing in on the left hand side beginning to click buttons on my screen and then creating this tool and testing out so that it can improve the tool without me even looking at it the cool thing about this is it can basically prototype a tool selfiterate self-improve and then once it's finally ready it will give me the details to check out but in the meantime it's just going to check out if it actually works or not and you can see it's adding values on the left hand side and then it's actually building this out on the right hand side and the numbers are updating in real time and then it's got the download PDF feature over here really cool it's taking screenshots testing the style we can actually change the from and the to information this is finished now and you can see that's finished on the preview with the agent because it doesn't have the blue lines around the edges anymore if we go back to anti-gravity now we can see that that's been tested and it's working perfectly beautiful and then if you want to host this online you just take the project files which you can see here so you can go to reveal and finder and grab the folder documents right like that and then you can host that on Netlify and basically use that as a tool that's hosting online and running online right pretty amazing the only thing that I would say that's a problem with this and I could easily just change this is that when we download the document the PDF it downloads the document but it doesn't save it as a PDF right so that's just something to be aware of but everything else is working perfectly and it's pretty amazing what you can do with this now I'm going to show you some more examples in a minute some people want to say "I need to know how to code to build tools." And the old story was like "Building apps required programming skills years of learning computer science degrees technical knowledge that takes forever to get." Here's the truth you already know how to describe what you want that's all you need now think about it this way when you order food at a restaurant do you need to know how to cook no you describe what you want the kitchen makes it anti-gravity is a kitchen you are the customer you don't need to know how the code works you just need to know what you want it to do and the new belief is if you can describe a tool in plain English you can build it easy as that so just pick one simple tool you wish existed for your business write down what it would do in three sentences boom that's your first build all right let's try something else out now so we're going to say okay build out a Pomodoro timer with a task list right so we're going to take this prompt over here again notes inside the AI success lab if you want to test this stuff out and learn from it and then we're going to click on that and use this to build out a new tool right we can build in the same project if we want to it's not a big deal obviously it's going to overwrite the old files but I'm not planning to use the old files anyway and then we're going to build this out as you can see all right so that's beginning to to create this document analyze it and start generating the outputs now in the meantime let's run through some more limiting beliefs that people struggle with so some people say building custom tools takes weeks or months and the old story was custom software is a huge project right planning development testing revisions it takes forever and can get expensive here's the truth i've built working tools in less time than it takes to make a coffee as you've seen today and the reason building used to take so long wasn't because the work itself was hard it was because humans had to translate your ideas into code line by line now AI does the translation instantly the new belief that you should have is what used to take weeks now takes minutes speed is no longer the bottleneck and your next step is really just time yourself describe a tool and see how fast it appears cuz you will be shocked and you can see that's beginning to generate now we've got the output over here you can see with the blue line around the edges this is beginning to test the tool it's a nice little Pomodoro task right so we're going to plug in the task the AI agent is going to plug in the task for me whilst I talk to you and then it should start the timer in a second as well right so it's plugged in the task which is finished report we'll return to the agent and now it started the timer right so the output worked perfectly first time around the UI is nice and clean we can actually switch between like short break whatever blah blah blah and then we can accept all the changes right i'm going to confirm that and then I'm going to stop the agent and you can see how we can just test this directly here right we can actually run we can grab the URL over here as well we can go back to our main window and start testing this out as you can see so it works perfectly we can refresh it we've got tasks that we can type in so for example let's put live stream here and that's a task and that works beautifully right and we've now built a custommade Pomodoro timer that works perfectly first time round for free locally whilst I've been talking to you and just jamming on the stuff that you can do with this right so it's amazing what you can build with this and it really isn't technical some people say free tools can't be that good and the old story was like good things are expensive and if it's free there must be a catch it probably doesn't work well for example but as you've seen today it does work well and here's the truth google gives away powerful door tools because they want you in their ecosystem email is free google Docs is free google search is free and these are like the best tools in the world antiggravity follows the same pattern google isn't being generous they're being strategic they want you building with their AI that benefits them it also benefits you a lot the best AI tools are often free because big companies want you using them so stop paying for expensive subscriptions before you test free alternatives that's the next step you might be surprised what's already available feel free to ask any questions as we go along by the way but you can see how powerful this is so let's talk about the antique growth action framework 30 days to building your business tool stack week one is the foundation day one to two I just focus with your first build to start simple you can build a Pomodoro timer with task tracking like I've done today this just teaches you the basics describe what you want testing results making tweaks and you'll have a working productivity tool and you'll understand how anti-gravity you think you get two birds in one stone day three to four your second build right build a daily time blocking planner so now you're getting comfortable you know how to describe things you're seeing patterns and what works and then day to five to seven build your first business tool this could be something that you actually need for your business it could be an invoice generator it might be a client intake form it might be a content calendar just pick something that you do manually and automate it right and then once you build something with this post it inside the AR profit border inside the win section and just share what you're building with us right i really want to see what people are building how we're learning you can see all the cool stuff inside the profit boarding community and what people are building it's amazing so for example like Robert Lawrence he said the automation light went off in my head i joined this group and he realized like oh I can automate my entire content creation workflow right and he said he's a full-time truck driver doesn't have much time but he's learned to automate one workflow that will help working whilst he's creating everything else so it can just save so much time when you figure out okay here's what I need to do next let's try something else now so I'm going to take this one as you can see and we're going to create a time tracking planner we'll plug that in to anti-gravity and start building this tool as well so that's beginning to build out whilst we're waiting for that let's talk through some tools that you could build you could build the prompt library manager so this could be a place to save organize and find all your best prompts the invoice generator as I've shown you today the content repurposing machine so you could turn one piece into your blog post a Twitter thread copy each version and that would save a lot of time right you could easily build that with anti-gravity the daily time blocking planner so you can plan your day visually drag to create time blocks which we're actually building right now with anti-gravity as you can see and then we've also got the offer builder as well right and so there's so much stuff you can build with this and if you want to see what's possible inside the AR profit bon members are getting results like this right so if pull this up this is 106 pages of happy clients from the AI profit boardroom so for example here Andrew said that he built his first AI avatar and created a video they'll go live on LinkedIn on Tuesday right pretty amazing you can see the time blocker is now being tested by the actually just opened that up and just started testing it as you can see we've got the blue background around the sides it's taking screenshots testing things out and it's beginning to block things out for like deep work gym lunch color coding it and just planning out the day pretty amazing so you can see the AI agent is really just testing this actually works before it goes ahead and builds anything let's open up another random page here see what we got so Eric coded his first iOS app with AI and he said I've got to give a huge shout out to Julian for the AR profit boardroom the community there has helped me so much along the way right let's see what else we got here so Marcus says here's why I'm impressed with a profit boardroom julian is actually present responding to questions showing up etc just going to X off that but you see now we've got the planner here i'm just going to stop this agent cuz it's getting a bit out of control but you can see how to use anti-gravity all the tools that we built today so for example the invoice generator the Pomodoro timer and the time block pro right which actually works kind of like a calendar app so it is amazing what you can do with this stuff how powerful it is how easy it is to build with this and how it works all right your homework i would pick one tool that would help your business the most describe what you want it to do in three simple sentences build it using anti-gravity post your results inside their profit and yeah that's basically how you can get it well if you join the air profit boardroom today you're also going access to the classroom with all of these different trainings as you can see you'll get access to the community where you can post in here and get help and support and advice and meet local people and share friends and everything else and then also inside the calendar you have coaching calls where you can jump on the coaching calls live with a PhD trained professor on Jeff and then ask any questions you want and get help and support in real time on those live coaching calls okay so you do that inside the AI profit boardroom and then also if you sign up today you also get access to our school training the AI avatar clone system where you can clone yourself and create AI video content like me you'll learn how to automate your Twitter so you can reach more customers like I do and generate more leads you'll get the Empire Focus manual which is my personal system for staying insanely productive and avoiding overwhelm you also get access to the free SEO boardroom and also the digital nomad blueprint as well right and you get all of this inside the apuffer boardroom when you join today so link in the comments in description for that you can also DM me inside there and get help and support it's the only place I personally connect with people and you get that directly inside the link in the comments description google dropped a free AI tool that codes for you and changes how SEO works forever this thing writes code automatically using AI agents that think and plan like humans it's built on Gemini 3 Google's newest AI brain that powers their search results right now and it could completely change how you rank content and build your business online i'm about to show you exactly what this means for your SEO strategy all right let's talk about what Google Anti-gravity actually is this is not another code helper that finishes your sentences this is a full IDE which means a coding environment that runs AI agents for you these agents plan tasks write code test it and verify it works all by themselves without you babysitting every step is powered by Gemini 3 Pro which is Google's most advanced AI model right now the same model running AI mode in Google search the same one in the Gemini app the same technology behind how Google is ranking and displaying content today here's what makes this different from every other coding tool you've tried traditional idees give you autocomplete you type a few letters and it suggests the rest anti-gravity gives you agents you tell it what you want to build and it figures out how to do it it opens files runs terminal commands checks the browser and fixes its own mistakes it's like having a developer working inside your computer and it's free right now windows Mac Linux any major programming language Python JavaScript TypeScript Java C++ Rust now here's where this gets interesting for co gemini 3 is not just powering anti-gravity it's powering Google search right now the new AI mode in search the Gemini app every API and developer tool Google makes this is the brain behind how Google is understanding and ranking content in 2025 so if you want to understand where SEO is going you need to understand how this AI thinks google just made Gemini 3 flash the default model everywhere is faster and cheaper than the old version more capable too and it's rolling out across search APIs Google AI Studio Vertex AI and anti-gravity this is the new standard for how Google processes information which means it's the new standard for how your content needs to be structured traditional SEO is dying fast keyword stuffing is dead backlink farms are dead writing for algorithms is dead because Google is not using simple algorithms anymore they're using AI that reads content like a human it understands context it checks authority it scans for structure it decides if your content is worth citing or not this is called generative engine optimization geo not SEO because Google is not just ranking pages anymore it's generating answers and if your content is not built for AI to scan understanded site you're invisible you could have perfect keywords and a million back links and still get zero traffic because the AI doesn't trust you here's what AI search actually looks for high authority content structured data semantic alignment third party citations scannable formatting justified claims if your page looks like a wall of text with no sources and no structure AI skips it if your page has schema markup clear headings cited sources and logical flow AI uses it one more thing if you're creating all this content with anti-gravity but nobody is finding it online you've got a traffic problem that's where SEO comes in if you want more leads more traffic and more sales my team can help you rank higher on Google check the link in the comments and description to order AI SEO online and let us handle your back links while you focus on growing your business let me show you how this works in practice let's say you're building content for AI profit boardroom that's a community teaching AI automation for businesses old SEO would say write an article about AI automation tools and stuff it with keywords new SEO says build a resource that AI can scan and site that means structured data telling Google what your page is about that means clear sections with headings that means linking to authority sources that means formatting that AI can pass in milliseconds let's talk about practical ways you can use anti-gravity right now first you can autogenerate landing pages imagine you need a new landing page for AI profit boardroom you tell anti-gravity to design a landing page that converts shows the value of AI automation and explains the benefits of the community it writes the HTML CSS and JavaScript it tests the layout in a browser it fixes responsive design issues it creates a working page in minutes instead of hours second you can generate SEO optimized content drafts tell anti-gravity to write an article about AI automation for small businesses it researches the topic using Gemini 3 it structures the content with proper headings it includes schema markup it formats everything for AI readability you get a first draft that's already built for generative search and you can build agentpowered workflows let's say you want to automate outreach for AI profit boardroom you tell anti-gravity to build a system that finds potential members personalizes messages and tracks responses the agent writes the code tests it and hands you a working automation you didn't write a single line of code yourself this is the power of agent first development you're not coding anymore you're directing you tell the AI what you want and it figures out how to build it that's why Google is betting big on this because if AI can code design test and deploy software by itself everyone becomes a builder you don't need to know Python or JavaScript you just need to know what you want to create now let's talk about installing this thing you go to the Google Developers site and download Anti-Gravity for your operating system Windows Mac or Linux the file is about 500 megabytes you install it like any other app when you open it you log in with your Google account that connects you to Gemini 3 Pro then you create a new project and start giving the agent instructions the interface looks like a normal code editor you've got files on the left code in the middle terminal at the bottom but there's also an agent panel where you chat with the AI you type what you want to build the agent asks clarifying questions then it starts working you watch it open files write code run tests and check results it creates artifacts which are verifiable outputs of what it did you can review everything and approve or modify it here's a real example let's say you want to build a lead magnet page for AI profit boardroom you tell anti-gravity to create a page that collects emails in exchange for a free AI automation guide you describe the design the copy style and the functionality you want the agent builds the HTML structure writes the CSS for styling adds JavaScript for form validation and creates a backend script to save emails it tests everything in a browser window it shows you the working page you make tweaks by chatting with the agent it updates the code in real time in 20 minutes you have a fully functional lead magnet page ready to deploy compare that to traditional development you'd write HTML for structure then CSS for design then JavaScript for interactivity then backend code for data handling then test everything manually then debug issues then test again that's hours or days of work anti-gravity does it in minutes because the agent handles all the steps this is why Gemini 3 and anti-gravity matter for your business you can build faster test faster launch faster and because Gemini 3 powers Google search the content and tools you build are already aligned with how Google ranks and displays information you're not guessing what works for AI search you're using the same AI that runs Google search this is the new game generative engine optimization your content needs to be good enough that an AI model feels confident citing it as a source that's a higher bar than traditional SEO but it's also more rewarding because when AI trusts you you get featured in AI generated answers you get visibility in AI mode search results you get traffic from people who never even click through to traditional links and here's the thing most businesses are not ready for this they're still doing old school SEO they're still chasing keywords and back links without understanding how AI processes content which means there's a massive opportunity right now for anyone who adapts fast if you start building content for AI search today you're ahead of 95% of your competition so here's what you need to do download anti-gravity and start experimenting build tools and pages that serve your audience structure your content for AI readability add schema markup to everything get cited by authority sources focus on depth and context instead of keywords and most importantly understand that Google's AI is not just ranking content it's deciding what's worth showing at all and one more thing if you're creating all this content with anti-gravity but nobody is finding it online you've got a traffic problem that's where SEO comes in if you want more leads more traffic and more sales my team can help you rank higher on Google check the link in the comments and description to order AI SEO online and let us handle your back links while you focus on growing your business google Anti-gravity Gemini 3.0 plus free opus 4.5 is insane today I'm going to show you how Google Gemini 3.0 Zero just changed the game with their new anti-gravity feature and Claude Opus 4.5 is now completely free these are the two most powerful AI tools right now and they just got massive upgrades by the end of this video you'll know exactly what these tools can do and how to use them google just dropped Gemini 3.0 this is their newest AI model and it's got something they're calling anti-gravity now before you think this is about physics or floating objects let me tell you what it actually does it's a complete overhaul of how Gemini processes and generates images the speed is insane the quality is better and it can handle way more complex prompts than before i'm talking about prompts that are 500 words long detailed descriptions multiple objects specific lighting exact colors before if you gave Gemini a super long prompt it would get confused it would miss details it would forget parts of what you asked for now with Gemini 3.0 you can throw everything at it and it handles it perfectly here's what changed under the hood google rebuilt the entire image processing system they call it anti-gravity because it lifts the weight off the model think about it like this old Gemini was carrying a backpack full of rocks while trying to create images new Gemini dropped the backpack it's faster it's cleaner it processes your requests without slowing down the quality jump is massive too images look more realistic colors are more accurate lighting is better shadows make sense before you'd get weird artifacts in your images random blobs distorted faces hands with six fingers gemini 3.0 fixed most of that not all of it the speed improvement is wild old Gemini took about 30 seconds to generate an image sometimes longer if your prompt was complex gemini 3.0 does it in under 10 seconds that's three times faster uh you can iterate way quicker now try one idea don't like it try another you're not sitting around waiting anymore now if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation I've got something special for you i run a community called the AI Profit Boardroom the best place to scale your business get more customers and save hundreds with AI automation learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools the link is in the comments and description it's at school.com/iiprofitlab now let's talk about Claude Opus 4.5 this just went free completely free no catch anthropic decided to make their most powerful model available to everyone this is huge opus 4.5 is their smartest model better than Sonnet better than Haiku and now you don't have to pay for it what can Opus 4.5 do everything writing coding analysis problem solving it's got a massive context window that means it can remember way more information in a conversation you can feed it entire documents whole code bases long research papers and it keeps track of everything the writing quality on Opus 4.5 is insane it doesn't sound like AI anymore it sounds human natural conversational you can ask it to write in any style formal casual technical creative and it nails it every time before you'd read AI writing and think "Yeah that's obviously AI." With Opus 4.5 people can't tell the difference coding got a massive upgrade too opus 4.5 can write entire applications not just snippets full programs it understands complex logic it can debug your code it can explain what's wrong and fix it i've seen people build entire web apps with just OPUS 4.5 no other tools needed here's the thing that makes OPUS 4.5 different from other AI models it actually thinks through problems most AI just spits out answers fast opus 4.5 takes its time it breaks down the problem it considers different approaches it gives you the best solution not just the first solution the analysis capabilities are next level you can feed it data spreadsheets reports research papers and it finds patterns you'd miss it connects dots it gives you insights that would take hours to figure out manually i'm talking about deep analysis here not surface level stuff now let me tell you why having both of these tools is powerful gemini 3.0 is your image powerhouse opus 4.5 is your text and logic powerhouse together they cover everything need to create visual content use Gemini need to write something complex or solve a problem use Opus need both use both here's a real world example say you're creating content for a website you need images you need text you need everything to match before you'd use one AI for images another for text they wouldn't match the style would be off the tone would be different now you can use Gemini 3.0 for all your images same style same quality then use Opus 4.5 for all your text everything flows together the fact that Opus 4.5 is free changes everything before you had to pay monthly now anyone can use it students creators small teams everyone gets access to the best AI writing and coding tool available that's massive let me talk about the technical side for a second gemini 3.0 runs on Google's TPUv5 chips these are customuilt for AI workloads way faster than regular GPUs that's part of why the speed improved so much google optimized everything from the ground up opus 4.5 uses a different architecture anthropic built it to be safer and more aligned that means it's less likely to make things up it's more accurate it follows instructions better and it refuses fewer requests because it actually understands context better both tools have been trained on massive data sets we're talking about trillions of parameters gemini 3.0 was trained on images text video and audio it's truly multimodal opus 4.5 focuses on text and code but goes way deeper quality over quantity here's what you need to know about using Gemini 3.0 effectively be specific with your prompts the more detail you give the better the better your output will be use the anti-gravity feature to your advantage this means you can ask for complex scenes multiple objects different angles specific perspectives don't hold back push the limits see what it can do for Opus 4.5 structure matters when you ask it to do something complex break it down give it steps say first analyze this then do that then conclude with this it follows instructions perfectly when you're clear use the long context window don't try to cram everything into short prompts give it all the information it needs background context examples the more you feed it the better it performs let's talk about what makes these updates different from previous releases most AI updates are incremental slightly better slightly faster these updates are transformational gemini 3.0 isn't just a bit better than Gemini 2.0 it's a completely different beast the anti-gravity system is a fundamental redesign same with Opus 4.5 going free this isn't just a price change it's a strategic move that opens up the most powerful AI model to millions of people who couldn't afford it before that's going to accelerate AI adoption like crazy the competition between AI companies is heating up google wants to dominate image generation anthropic wants to be the go-to for writing and coding open AI is somewhere in the middle trying to do everything the this competition is good for us it means faster updates better features lower prices here's something most people don't realize these AI models get better every single day they don't just update once every few months the training continues the fine-tuning continues every time you use them you're using a slightly better version than yesterday that's wild gemini 3.0 learns from every image it generates if something doesn't look right the feedback goes back into the system next time it creates something similar it's better this continuous improvement is built into the core system opus 4.5 does the same thing with text and code every conversation makes it smarter every correction teaches it something new this isn't static technology it's living technology that evolves let me address something important some people worry about AI replacing jobs that's not what's happening here these tools amplify what you can do they don't replace you think about it before calculators people did math by hand calculators didn't replace mathematicians they made math faster and more accessible same thing here gemini 3.0 doesn't replace designers it lets designers work faster and try more ideas opus 4.5 doesn't replace writers it lets writers focus on the creative parts while handling the repetitive stuff the people who win with AI are the ones who learn how to use it effectively that's why understanding these tools matters not just knowing they exist actually knowing how to use them now if you want to dive even deeper into AI automation I've got something special for you i run a community called the AI Profit Boardroom the best place to scale your business get more customers and save hundreds with AI automation learn how to save time and automate your business the link is in the comments and description it's at school.com/iprofitlab and if you want the full process SOPs and 100 plusa I use cases like this one join the AI success lab links in the comments and description google just launched something wild it's called anti-gravity and it came out on November 18th 2025 this is not just another coding tool most AI coding tools give you suggestions they help you write code faster but anti-gravity it actually builds entire apps for you full apps with testing with browser automation with everything and I'm going to show you exactly how to use it so what is anti-gravity it's an AI powered IDE built on top of a Visual Studio Code if you've used VS Code before this will feel familiar but Google added AI agents and these agents don't just help you they actually do the work for you you tell the AI what you want like build me a stock tracking app and then the AI goes away and builds it it writes the code it opens the browser it tests everything it takes screenshots it debugs issues you just watch it work when you first open anti-gravity you see something that looks like VS Code but here's the secret you're not going to use that screen much instead click on the agent manager this is where the magic happens the agent manager is like a control center you can see all your AI agents working you can manage multiple projects at once it's like being a manager of a whole team but the team is AI the agent manager has three main parts first workspaces this is where your main projects live second playgrounds this is where you test ideas quickly third the inbox this is where your AI agents message you when they're done or need approval let me walk you through building something say you want to build a stock tracking app you open a workspace create a new folder an AI agent appears now here's a pro tip give it good instructions be specific tell it what text stack to use tell it what features you want and here's the key give it visual inspiration gemini 3 powers anti-gravity and it's amazing at building user interfaces but only if you show it what you want here's what you do go to a tool called VZero describe the UI you want vzero builds it in seconds take a screenshot paste it into anti-gravity tell it to use that as inspiration this makes a huge difference and before I go further if you want to learn how to use AI tools like anti-gravity to automate your business and save hours every single day check out AI Profit Boardroom we dive deep into AI automation we show you exactly how to use tools like this to build apps automate tasks and get more done no fluff just real strategies link in the description so you give the agent your instructions you attach your screenshot hit send the agent starts working and as it works it creates artifacts what are artifacts when they're documents plans screenshots code files everything the agent does gets saved you can open the implementation plan while the agent is working you can read what it's planning to do you can review everything step by step here's another cool feature the agent tests your app as it builds it it opens a browser it clicks buttons it enters text it takes screenshots all automatically because Google makes Chrome they integrated it perfectly the AI has full control over the browser now here's a pro tip nobody talks about as the AI is testing your app you can leave annotations you see a screenshot you notice something you want to change you can highlight part of the screenshot leave a comment like add a crypto section here the AI will see that comment and start working on it you're giving feedback in real time but here's where anti-gravity gets really interesting you can spin up more agents click the plus button in agent manager create a second agent tell it to add portfolio tracking now you have two agents working at the same time they work in parallel they don't interfere with each other you can create different types of agents not just coding agents create a product manager agent tell it to look at your app and create a road map create a marketing agent tell it to write blog posts and tweets you can have a whole team of AI agents each one doing different work you're just managing them and those playgrounds say you're working on your main app but suddenly you have an idea for something completely different maybe a game you don't want to mess up your main workspace go to the playground create a new experiment tell the AI to build it if you like it move it to a workspace if you don't delete it now let's talk about the inbox as you have multiple agents working they all communicate through the inbox agent one finish the portfolio feature message agent two finish the marketing content message everything shows up in one place you can review each thing you can approve or reject you can give more instructions here's the mindset shift you need with normal coding you're the builder you write every line but with anti-gravity you're the manager you tell your team what to build they go build it they come back with questions you give approval this is huge you're not bottlenecked by how fast you can type code you're only limited by how many agents you can manage now I want to be real with you anti-gravity is not perfect it's still in public preview there are bugs there are issues sometimes the AI doesn't follow instructions perfectly gemini 3 has some rough edges compared to Claude but Google is working on it here's something important anti-gravity agents have a lot of power they can edit code they can run terminal commands they can control your browser this creates security risks some researchers found vulnerabilities right after launch there was even a case where someone used turbo mode and the agent accidentally deleted their entire hard drive no warning just deleted everything so here's my advice always back up your work don't use anti-gravity for critical production projects yet treat it like an experimental sandbox but for side projects for prototypes for learning anti-gravity is amazing you can build apps so fast just be smart about it use planning mode instead of fast mode for complex tasks review the artifacts don't blindly trust everything check the code be the manager stay in control here are the key practices always back up your work use planning mode for anything complex give the AI visual inspiration read the artifacts as the AI works use annotations on screenshots start simple build a small app first get comfortable with the workflow then tackle bigger projects you can build web apps stock trackers toou apps portfolio sites games admin dashboards pretty much anything you can use it to prototype ideas fast you can use it to learn coding by watching how the AI builds things and the text stack is flexible anti-gravity supports Nex.js JS React Vue plain HTML and CSS Python JavaScript TypeScript and more if you want to master AI automation and learn how to use cuttingedge tools like anti-gravity to transform how you work join AI Profit Boardroom we're constantly testing new tools finding what works and teaching you exactly how to implement them this is where you learn to stay ahead link in the description here's what makes this different from every other AI tool out there most tools are stuck in chat mode you ask a question it gives an answer you ask another question it gives another answer it's slow it's tedious but anti-gravity breaks that model completely your agents work independently they make decisions they test things they fix bugs they don't wait for you to hold their hand this is the first time we've seen truly autonomous AI coding and it changes everything here's what you need to do right now go download anti-gravity it's free google is giving tons of free credits install it open the agent manager create a workspace build something simple a to-do app a calculator anything then start experimenting with multiple agents create a playground try different ideas get comfortable with the workflow the key things to remember use visual inspiration for better UIs use planning mode for complex tasks annotate screenshots to give better feedback spin up multiple agents for different tasks use playgrounds for quick experiments check your inbox regularly back up your work and shift your mindset from builder to manager today we're talking about anti-gravity this is Google's brand new AI development platform and it's wild this thing can build full apps from scratch it can fix bugs automatically it can even create pull requests for you but before you go crazy with it I need to show you something important because there it's been some scary incidents already i'll get to that in a minute but first let me show you what this thing can actually do anti-gravity is basically an AI agent that lives inside your development environment it's not just a code helper it's a full autonomous agent it can plan tasks execute them and verify everything worked and it does all of this across your editor your terminal and your browser the platform is powered by Gemini 3 that's Google's latest AI model and it's specifically built for agentic work the AI can break down big tasks into smaller steps execute each step check if it worked and move to the next one all without you doing anything here's what makes anti-gravity different most AI tools just suggest code you still have to copy it paste it run it yourself anti-gravity does all of that automatically it edits your files directly it runs terminal commands it can even open your browser and test your app now I know what you're thinking that sounds powerful but also kind of scary and you're right let me tell you about what happened recently there was an incident where a developer used anti-gravity's turbo mode the AI agent started running commands and it accidentally deleted a bunch of important files just gone because the agent had full access to the terminal security researchers have been warning about this they found that these agents can be tricked with prompt injection basically bad actors could hide malicious instructions in files and when the AI reads those files it executes those instructions that could mean stealing your API keys deleting your database or exposing sensitive data so here's the deal anti-gravity is incredibly powerful but you need to use it safely i'm going to show you exactly how to do that let's start with the coolest demo building a complete app from nothing i'm going to ask Anti-gravity to create a to-do app with React Express SQLite tests a Docker file and a CI pipeline here's the exact prompt create a todo app using React Plus Express plus SQLite add tests docker file and create a GitHub actions pipeline watch what happens the agent creates a plan it breaks down the task into steps then it starts executing you can see it creating files in real time app.jsx for React server.js for Express database schema test files everything now it moves to the terminal it installs dependencies runs the tests the test pass then it builds the Docker container and starts the app locally i can open my browser and there it is a fully working to-do app i can add tasks check them off delete them everything works and I didn't write a single line of code that took maybe 3 minutes to build something that would normally take hours but here's what I want you to notice before the agent ran any terminal commands it showed me what it was about to do i could approve or reject each action that's important julian Goldie reads every comment so make sure you comment below and let me know what kind of app you'd build with this here's another workflow that's super useful let's say you have a project with failing tests you know something's broken but you don't know what with anti-gravity you can just ask it to fix the problem here's my prompt investigate failing unit tests reproduce locally propose and apply a fix add a regression test and create a PR the agent looks at the test output sees which tests are failing then it examines the code to find the root cause the agent writes a fix updates the code runs the tests again and now they all pass but it doesn't stop there it also writes a new test to make sure this bug doesn't happen again then it creates a pull request with a detailed commit message explaining what was wrong and how it was fixed this is huge for developers because bug fixing takes up so much time and this agent can do it automatically before I show you the third demo let me tell you about something really cool if you want to learn how to actually use AI tools like anti-gravity to save time and automate your business you need to check out AI Profit Boardroom this is where we show you the exact AI tools and workflows that can transform how you work whether you're building apps creating content or running a business AI can handle the boring stuff so you can focus on what matters click the link in the description to learn more this third workflow is where safety really matters let's say you need to refactor some code and run a security scan here's my prompt refactor function Y to improve performance and run a secret scan do not change production configs or push secrets notice how I specifically told it not to touch production configs that's important you need to give the agent clear boundaries the agent starts the refactor cleans up the code then it runs the security scan the scan finds a potential issue there's an API key hard-coded in a config file the agent flags this it shows me a warning and it asks if I want to proceed i can reject this action or I can tell it to remove the API key and use environment variables instead this is the evidence trailing action every step the agent takes is logged so you can review what happened and make sure nothing dangerous was executed okay let's talk about how to use this safely because like I said there have been incidents here are the rules rule number one always run agents in a sandbox or a dedicated virtual machine never run them on production servers rule number two disable automatic destructive commands no automatic RM RF no global pseudo access rule number three require manual approval for any terminal commands that could be dangerous rule number four always review the evidence logs before you accept any changes read through what the agent did rule number five use dummy credentials for testing don't give the agent access to real API keys or production databases and rule number six avoid using turbo mode on anything important turbo mode lets the agent run faster by skipping approval steps but that's exactly how things go wrong these rules might seem like overkill but trust me they're not security researchers have found real vulnerabilities prompt injection attacks file exfiltration risks destructive command execution the good news is that Google is aware of these issues and they're working on better safeguards but until those are in place you need to protect yourself here's why anti-gravity is such a big deal with tools like this anyone can build software you just need to know what you want to build the AI handles the technical details that means more people can turn their ideas into real products small businesses can build custom tools without hiring expensive developers entrepreneurs can test ideas faster but this technology is brand new is still in public preview there will be bugs there will be mistakes and yes there will be security issues that's why you need to learn how to use it safely now if you want to stay ahead of AI tools like this you need to join AI Profit Boardroom we break down every new AI tool show you how to use them and teach you how to automate your business safely click the link in the description to learn more all right that's anti-gravity Google's new AI agent platform it can build full apps fix bugs automatically and handle complex development workflows let me walk you through how this actually works let's say you want to build an app you tell the anti-gravity agent to initialize Firebase in your project the agent then generates an implementation plan if it needs more info from you it asks questions when it's done it shows you a step-by-step walkthrough of what it did the whole process is automated but you're still in control now here's a real example someone used anti-gravity to build a racing game they asked for email and password signin they asked for a cloud fire store leaderboard and anti-gravity using Firebase MCP tools did everything automatically it fetched the API keys it added authentication it set up the fire store logic it wrote the game code then it just worked no debugging no fixing errors it just worked think about what this means you're not writing Firebase initialization code anymore you're not hunting for API keys in the console you're not setting up you know authentication flows manually you're not writing database rules the the AI agent does all of this and it does it right the first time the deployment part is even crazier once your app is built the agent already knows how to deploy it uses Firebase hosting it checks all the steps using MCP then it runs Firebase deploy only hosting fully automated you ask it to deploy and it deploys and the MCP server also supports app hosting for Nex.js and Angular apps and this is where things get interesting because Firebase MCP works with Gemini agents too so you're not just limited to anti-gravity you can use these same tools in other environments the protocol is open which means more AI tools will start using it and when they do app development becomes even easier now if you're watching this and thinking "Holy crap I need to learn how to build apps with AI tools like anti-gravity and Firebase MCP," then you need to join my AI profit boardroom this is where I teach you how to use AI agents and automation tools to build real products you'll learn how to scale your business with the exact same AI development tools I'm showing you today you'll get access to workflows that show you how to automate app development how to use MCP servers how to build with AI agents like the ones in anti-gravity plus you'll save hundreds of hours because you'll learn which AI tools actually work so back at it the speed of development with this setup is insane apps that used to take weeks now take hours apps that used to take days now take minutes and the quality doesn't drop because the AI is following best practices it's using the right Firebase features is setting up proper security it's not cutting corners and here's something most people miss when you use Firebase MCP with anti-gravity you're also learning because the agent explains what it's doing it shows you the code it writes it walks you through the Firebase setup so even if you're not a Firebase expert now you will be after using this you'll understand how everything connects you'll understand why certain patterns work you'll level up your skills while the AI does the work the deployment process is seamless too once your app is ready anti-gravity can push it live it handles the hosting configuration it sets up the domain it manages the build process you go from idea to live app without switching tools everything happens in one place and if something needs to change the agent can update and redeploy just as easily here's what you should do next if you're building apps try anti-gravity add the Firebase MCP server build something small first see how it works see what the agent can do and scale up build something bigger push the limits because this technology is new and the people who learn it now will have a huge advantage now let me tell you what Google has been working on behind the scenes they've been making sure that the Firebase MCP server works really well with not only the Gemini CLI but all the places where you might want to use an MCP server and the biggest one is anti-gravity IDE Google's newest release so they built this integration from the ground up to be seamless and it shows here's exactly how you add Firebase MCP to anti-gravity you open anti-gravity you go to the drop-own menu in the agent window you select MCP servers then you choose Firebase from the list of available MCP servers this opens a description of the MCP server and you just click install that's it the Firebase MCP server is now added to anti-gravity and now the real magic starts so the first thing you want to do is link your current app to Firebase you tell the agent to initialize Firebase in your current project the agent then develops an implementation plan it uses the MCP server to link Firebase to your project if the agent needs more information to complete a task it pauses and asks for your input you answer it continues once the task is complete anti-gravity provides a walkthrough of the steps it took to link Firebase to your app so you're not just getting results you're learning the process now here's where it gets fun you can ask anti-gravity to actually build your app using anti-gravity you can specify a series of steps that you want the agent to take in building your app someone prompted it to build a racing game they wanted sign in using email and password login from Firebase they wanted Cloud Fire Store for a leaderboard and anti-gravity using its suite of MCP tools from the Firebase MCP server fetch the API keys for the web app automatically no need to visit the Firebase console it implemented both features without issue then they tested the game and it worked exactly as expected first try but it doesn't stop at building you can deploy the app with Firebase hosting too the anti-gravity agent already has access to Firebase hosting via the Firebase MCP server the agent can consult with the Firebase MCP server to verify the steps to deploy to Firebase hosting the agent makes a deployment plan this includes compiling the code then running the Firebase deploy only hosting command to get the app onto Firebase hosting you don't need to run any commands yourself you just ask the agent to deploy for you once this is done you can share the game you built with your friends or your customers or whoever you want and the Firebase MCP server also supports app hosting which is optimized for server rendered Nex.js and Angular web apps so if you're building more complex applications you're covered there too so here's my final thought anti-gravity plus Firebase MCP isn't just an IDE update it's the future of app development ai agents with full control i have full automation your ideas turned into fully built apps and we're seeing this happen right now not in five years not in 10 years right now 2025 is going to be wild this is how you accelerate your app development with anti-gravity with the Firebase MCP server and with AI agents that actually work now if you're watching this and thinking "Holy crap I need to learn how to build apps with AI tools like anti-gravity and Firebase MCP," then you need to join my AI profit boardroom this is where I teach you how to use AI agents and automation tools to build real products you'll learn how to scale your business with the exact same AI development tools I'm showing you today you'll get access to workflows that show you how to automate app development how to use MCP servers how to build with AI agents like the ones in anti-gravity plus you'll save hundreds of hours because you'll learn which AI tools so what I'm going to try now I'm going to take my landing page here for my backlink portal take that screenshot it we're going to open up a new project inside the ID so if we go to new window and we'll close this old one let's close that there we go open up a new folder we'll call this new folder website Black Friday seo website Black Friday open up then I'm going to say right past so we've got the screenshot here and we're going to say okay create better more modern version of this page this landing page/epage website then I'm going to say direct all the traffic to my SEO checkout page that's your services URL equals that we should be good to go on that all right and we'll see what we can build out here i want to switch back hit the limit on all right let's switch back to Claude Sonic you can actually check which ones you've hit the limit on so you can see here for example Gemini High uh not available until 9:34 a.m right which is 4 hours away for me i'm an early riser i'm doing this live stream super early and then we've got another one Gemini 3 Pro that's not available until 9:34 a.m so it's loading it right here but yeah you can use these for like website redesign apps SAS tools etc just give it whatever idea you want now I mean some people are going to say right I'm not smart enough to use AI tools but you know anti-gravity understands whatever you want without having to to really be very clear about what you want right like if you have an idea you're good to go yeah so you can you can just basically give this what you want another one is some people say like anti-gravity is a little bit overwhelming but you can literally just type in one sentence into anti-gravity and it'll it'll basically give you exactly what you want as you've seen today some people say I'm scared of like breaking something but anti-gravity actually keeps your history of what you've created so you can like just go back and undo what you've done previously some people say it looks too advanced but even though this tool can be advanced you can use it in a really simple way too and also this works with like any normal file so you don't need to be a code or anything like that um yeah and the other cool thing is it's hosted locally as well so you know you can come back to it when you want you've got privacy and that sort of thing now I want to show you this 30-day plan as well right so I would you know I would test out for like 1 to 3 days just give it some small tasks then day four to 7 sort of help you know let it help you fix things ask it why it made certain changes uh start looking at the explanations and then you know day 8 to 14 you can start building out a real project let it organize all the messy side of things and ask it to explain the whole system to you too then you can build new features maybe day 15 to 20 you build one new feature or one new feature a day and you can also then start using like the browser the terminal the editor and yeah you know you can learn this stuff in like 30 days pretty simple and easy so let's see what we got back here anti-gravity is still coding out there i think it's a little bit slow with claw 4.5 to be funny to be honest especially when you're starting that new project from from scratch we got Igore hello Igore good to see you and if we go back to anti-gravity now it's beginning to create the foundations so we're pasting in that screenshot giving it ideas of what we want but again like if it's a brand new project from scratch it may take a little while right to to really start coming back in and then you can open up previous projects here as well so if you right click the icon you've got your window that's actually open with your project and then you can open up these test projects here so I could open up my website or the Black Friday website the test project as a folder inside the IDE too and again you can switch between planning and fast so now it's beginning to code that out it's giving us all the code inside the index html that's just creating the foundation obviously it needs to create the CSS and everything else i can accept the changes there and then it will keep going someone's asking like does it have usage limits so yeah like you have limits on each of the APIs you use now these are free APIs you're using but you can see that we I can't use Gemini 3.0 for like 3 hours now or 5 hours so these two I can't use for a while so it's actually 4 hours I can't use it for because it's not It tells you when it's available right so it says you've reached a quot limit for Gemini 3 Pro low you can resume using this model at 9:34 a.m which is not great that is not great so I'm kind of locked out from improving it with Gemini 3 for 4 hours and then Claude Sonnet and Claude 4.5 Sonet Thinking and GT OSS I can still use in the meantime but the problem is they're not as good at coding right so that's one of the biggest issues you're going to find people says "Oh no I used to follow you on YouTube but I started seeing AI avatar videos and then I stopped watching but like let's see it again." Well it's good to have you back thanks for watching again like you can just watch the live streams if you want and then you skip all the AI avatar stuff does it have a minimum model which you can use when all your limits are full yeah so it' be GPTO OSS that you would use for that right so for the minimum model you use GPTO OSS so I mean the thing is right now you know probably from everything that you've seen right now like you're probably spending about 40 hours a week uh doing tasks that AI could handle in minutes so from what I see inside the comments and everything else today like a lot of people are struggling with AI um if you need help with this like check out the AI profit boarding all right so for example we've got inside the AI profit boarding we have the we have the AI automation blueprint and basically this shows you how to build AI systems that run on autopilot so you can stop wasting time on repetitive tasks so for example if we go inside the AI profit volume here you can see automations for content creation lead generation shorts etc ai avatar videos these are all sorts of things that are included inside the community um we also have the advanced Facebook ads growth training so this is my complete playbook for building engaged audiences and active communities on Facebook on top of that you get the school community building training so yeah if you actually type in school here you get tons of training on how I've built communities with school if you want to learn this stuff yourself as you can see and then I'll basically show you how I built and scaled multiple thriving communities on school so like the setup the structure the engagement tactics and everything else on top of that you're going to get the 100 M AI content machine so this is where you can take one single idea and turn it into over a 100 pieces of content across every single platform so you've probably seen me on X maybe you've seen me on Instagram maybe on Facebook ads maybe on LinkedIn on YouTube on multiple different channels on YouTube etc basically this machine here shows you exactly how to do it um and how to save over 20 hours per week doing this right and then you also get the high ticket service delivery formula so this is the process I've used to scale AI automation services to clients you get all my frameworks delivery systems communication templates etc inside the air profit boardroom you also get the AI avatar content system so you're going to learn how to build AI avatars to create content for you that sound like you and post for you so for example if you have a look at my YouTube channel these videos are all like AI avatar videos that get thousands of views they reach millions of people and um and we've automated we've got a great system for automating this stuff right what else we got here so you also get the school empire system so this shows you how I built school communities with AI all the funnels I build etc the Twitter growth system as well so if you've seen me on Twitter for example you've probably seen my AI content we reach again millions of people per month on X and uh we're constantly publishing content which is automated with AI you get all those systems inside the profit port 2 and then also you get the AI workflow vault so you get access to over 1,000 pre-built NA10 automations you get daily Q&A with me so you can ask me anything about AI automation or building your business and you know if it's something complicated I actually create a video and help you with the answer top of that you get unlimited tech support so you get unlimited tech support where you can get help with any issues inside the A prof you can just create a thread get fast answers etc so if you have a look here for example people are posting um and asking for help and stuff like that for example like Steve he actually set up a new YouTube channel with AI and reached over 200,000 people which is pretty crazy you see all these different posts that people are creating and sharing and then they get help and support from our community all right you also get week uh weekly coaching calls so you get weekly coaching calls where you can show up ask questions get feedback and watch me work through problems in real time along with my team we'll help you during those live calls we have a bunch of giveaways and that's everything you get right so you get the AI automation blueprint the Facebook growth training the school community system the 100M content machine the service delivery formula the AI avatar system the school empire training the Twitter growth system over 1,000 pre-built workflows daily Q&A with me unlimited tech support and five live coaching course a week plus monthly giveaways and um if you sign up now on their Black Friday deal which is only available for a few more hours then you will save 35% forever right so you sign up to that price now and then you lock in your 35% discount forever by signing up here you just sign up to the aircraft boardroom link in the comments in description to get that so it's an absolute steal right now what we got here yeah let's keep going through now so if we go back to anti-gravity here we've plugged in the details of our landing page that we want to create then we said create better more modern version of the landing page blah blah blah direct all the traffic here this is the URL and uh if we click on view we can see the landing page and we can see the AI scrolling through it right now that landing page looks so much nicer than the original if you want to actually open it up you can open it up inside the Aentic browser which you can see all right so this is the example page if we scroll up it's got the it's it's got the details here so it looks super nice it gives us a code to use if we click on this link it should take us to the checkout page by the way this is a real deal right so if you actually want help with AICO feel free to order online link in the comments description but yeah we you can order online we've got a huge Black Friday deal right now for 30% off so if you type in Black Friday on the checkout page you will save 30% when you order here and then you can use uh select whichever package you want so you can select like backlinks here so you can say "Right okay I want five or seven backlinks for my website." Apply the code and then boom you can get access this is way way cheaper than uh our normal agency service as well cuz you order in online and then you can also select multiple packages so you could go with the SEO starter package the SEO power pack or the premium pack as well and then you just fill in your details here and you can pay online so if we have a look at this page this looks a lot nicer than the original so if we go back to let me show you what the original look like so if we open up this is the original page with the YouTube video the headline etc it looks okay but it's a little bit messy when it comes to the design and everything else right whereas if we have a look at the new design this is the new version it looks a lot nicer right everything's aligned it's all cleaned up it's all tidy etc yeah it's looking really good that and then you can actually insert a demo video here it just looks a lot cleaner right and I think that demonstrates a lot more trust it's taken exactly the same copy but it's just redesigned it with our brand colors it's even for example it's even included like some of the benefits that I didn't mention previously got the limited time offer testimonials and then the CTAs i would say that's a much nicer design page especially this section right here it looks super nice let's try and preview it on mobile if we can can we preview on mobile we can change the device here yeah there we go so this is the version on mobile here and then we can scroll down it's It's not looking as good on on mobile to be honest with you but we've redesigned the whole page there so it's pretty simple and easy to do this sper says that's a pretty well done site from one single prompt yeah I agree with you there i think that looks pretty nice so yeah you can build websites pretty quickly i mean like building websites used to be a nightmare whereas uh now you can easily just create them in one single prompt like I've shown you today and uh you type in simple words whatever you want and it just fix things i used to spend like hours fixing this sort of stuff and you know you get buses that break layouts look weird code that makes no sense etc but with anti-gravity that saves a lot of time it's way faster and again like some people say "I'm not good at coding but Antiggravity basically writes a code for you." Some people say websites look too complex but anti-gravity basically explains it to you like a teacher if you ask it and yeah it's it's super fast and easy to do now I think you could really use this for SEO as well to create like micro sites so you can see for example this is a website where we're publishing content consistently we have multiple different websites we're doing this on like airoft boarding this world you can see some examples of of the traffic we get to this website so within the last um 3 months you can see we get thousands of clicks here but basically we could use this and and then create content across multiple different platforms i want to find another example here yeah so this is another website as well but I think you could really leverage anti-gravity to create micro sites for you so what you can actually do if you wanted to use Google anti-gravity for SEO is you could go to press find some keywords where you can build little micro sites around so for example let's say I don't know SEO training or something like that right and you can create a little micro site based on like some low competition keywords so if we have a look here we're going to type in like KD10 LS see what we got maybe KD 20s let's have a look here see what we can create content all right select enterprise SEO ROI calculator and that's actually that's a website that I own and vibe coded with AI right so if we click on book a free strategy session it funnels traffic to our book a call page right and it's ranking number one for that keyword so if we go on to Google here you can see us ranking number one even after we coded it like about a year ago let's open this up in a new incognito just to make sure yes you can see us ranking number one for that keyword right and the way that we did this and vibe coded out so we actually used bold previously but basically what you want to do is just find low competition keywords right so ideally like keyword difficulty 10 or less you can find a bunch of micro site ideas here so for example like SEO like calculator whatever your niche is just type in your niche and then calculator so I have an SEO agency so that's why I'm doing SEO and then from here we can pick out different keywords we want to rank for so for example SEO cost calculator tool right now what we can do is we can go back over to anti-gravity we can start up a new project so I'm going to click on new window here we'll close the old one so I'm going to X off the old one here click on open folder new folder type in the keyword of the micro site i'm going to create SEO cost calculator tool hit open then from here what we can do is we can say okay create a beautiful landing page website modern etc optimized for the keyword uh keywords right and then we're going to say funnel traffic to my SEO agency booker call page here right and then right out of the landing page copy selling SEO services as gold agency and following traffic to book a call that's right and then what you can actually do is put in your brand colors as well so I'm going to just write that there there's our brand colors so put brand colors here we go hit enter and then we can just vibe code out a landing page or micro site pretty quickly v code that out host it on net file wherever you want code it out locally and then start ranking on on Google pretty simple and easy so if if you're wondering okay like can you find easy keywords to rank for using this absolutely i've shown you even in the SEO industry which is a pretty difficult niche to rank in you can see how easy it was for me to find low competition keywords so we can create a rank can we actually rank on Google for those target keywords absolutely so this is a page that we created a year ago it's a calculator ranking for that keyword it funnels traffic to my funnels here and uh it's really easy to build out these SEO sites using anti-gravity it's even outranking for example HFS or even my main website so it's outranking Julianolder.com is outranking HRES which is a super powerful website and uh we've done it using this process here right pretty simple and easy and it gets like 4,000 impressions doesn't get a lot of clicks but you can see how it works and then if you want to actually code this out you can use anti-gravity how would you do it you use a prompt like this if you want to get that prompt I'll put it inside the AR profit boardroom so let me go inside here example prompt for websites let me There we go hit save boom so if we go back to anti-gravity that's coding out here and now it's just working on building that out step by step might take a few minutes as we've seen today but it's it's pretty easy you could also use Bolt you could use Love Wall etc i'm just going to close this one down there we go we're using Claude Sonic again cuz those limits have been hit on Gemini 3 so we can't use Gemini 3 Pro for like 4 hours so just be aware that you can hit limits pretty quickly and actually if I was doing this all over again I'd probably start with planning mode so switch to planning mode inside anti-gravity first and then you can use fast mode later for anti-gravity and then sporter says low competition keywords you would only pick one per micro site absolutely right so if you go back now for example like here right here you would just pick one of these keywords so you're not going to try and rank for SEO ROI calculator and enterprise SER calculator you would only pick one right and inside the URL you want it to be exact match so for example if we're targeting this keyword enterprise SEO calculator then inside the domain we're going to put that domain.com right so that we can start ranking for it and then you just want to make sure as well you can monetize this so for example if I have an SEO agency I'm going to rank for SEO keywords uh because typically people are searching for SEO problems on Google need help with SEO so it's now building this out and uh we should get that back in a second it's creating the index html here so you can preview the code on this side and you can see the files on the left hand side i also like the fact that it's just so clean and easy to use this stuff which is pretty nice and then you can also reveal in Finder right so if you want to find this inside your your finder and um and just see the actual file itself you just go to review and finder you can also copy the relative path you can reopen the editor as well yeah that's basically how it works and then it's coding out right as you can see here so I think what it will do next is code there CSS we'll see how that goes and then the other thing you want to do here as well is like with this website we have a look at this site that's ranking number one for this keyword right we want to put the URL into hrefs and um you can see that we've built 33 back links to this page right so you can see the organic traffic for this page here organic traffic has grown as we build more backlinks to it right how do we build back links to it we just build back links from there there's actually a few like automated websites here so I'm just going to go with one link per domain do follow show results there we go right so what we do is we find relevant pieces of content and we link that to the website right so from here to here and if you're wondering okay what a backlinks what do they look like etc so you can see that's an example of a backlink it's just a clickable text from one website to another we've built it from our site that powers up our site pretty simple and easy and the more backlinks you have from relevant authority sources so this is a website about SEO we've built links to this page about SEO the the more power that website has so for example from Julian.com from Julian.co.uk DK with link directly to this ROI calculator page right pretty simple that's the way that I like to look at SEO as well it's just like you know make it as simple as possible so I'm going to say okay is this still coding out it seems to have got stuck i'm going to say preview this now see if we can preview it out what else we got here all right so basically this has got to create the CSS first so if we go back to anti-gravity here it's still got to create the CSS and again the quality of the CSS the quality of the website itself will depend on the API you use so Claude 4.5 Sonic I would expect the API to be pretty nice for coding but GP OSS I think you're not going to get the best results from that to be honest you can also see there's an update available for this so if you restart to update you can get that access right there but yeah that's basically how it works right i'm not going to wait forever for that to code but you can see how easy this is to do and then from here if you wanted to host this stuff what you're going to do is just open up the folder you want to host it on so for example like Julian Cordi website as you can see right this is a page with VIP coded out little micro site again and you would just go over to Netlify login i might have to log in with GitHub to be honest there we go and then we've just I've just got a verification code in the background and then once you're logged in to Netlefi you can just upload your project files right so for example Julian Golden Automation this is a website we uploaded earlier you can see the page right here and the way this works is you would just go to projects add new project import an existing project try netifi drop and then grab the folder from locally that anti-gravity is coded out right and so for example like this we've got the folder right here and you just grab that folder and plug it into Netlifi right so you just grab that folder and then you can drop it in like that yeah and that's going to upload your SEO calculator whatever you created and then deploy it online right pretty simple and easy so that's how it works peeps that's how you can use uh Netify md says "If you want you can reach millions of people your videos through YouTube why don't you do it?" I already do so maybe you probably haven't seen my analytics obviously but like if you check out my analytics you can see just in the last year we reached 25 million people through YouTube so we reach a lot of people on YouTube we reach millions of people all right so that's basically how you can use this stuff um if you want to get help with SEO check out the Black Friday deal that we have so right now we have this Black Friday deal on you can save 30% if you order SEO online so you just click on this link link in the comments description to the backlink portal click on the link you can order online here if you prefer a call first you can book in a call first here and then you can select whichever package you want so for example here you can select how many backlinks you want so let's say for example you want six back links DR30 and then just put in the coupon code so for example Black Friday here hit apply and you'll save 30% or you can choose like the SEO starter package or whatever you want right and then you just check out below so that is a Black Friday deal was only available until Black Friday of course and uh it's pretty simple and easy to order online but yeah the main thing I would say here is like you know a lot of people watching this they've probably got a website but they're not getting traffic right and so if you're if you're if you've got a website and you know you're being outranked by your competitors who are sitting at the top of Google getting all the clicks all the attention etc all the new customers and you're wondering okay what do they know that you don't well that basically ends today right because I'm showing you the SEO frameworks that are going to help you rank and if you order here you can get the SEO frameworks that that work for me and I've already shown you multiple websites that are getting traffic and and getting and ranking on Google so if you order online you're going to get all of these different packages you can just

more traffic more visibility more customers finding you on Google this is the moment that you can start implementing all right so let's see what else we've got on the comments here any tips on how to keep your computer performance working whilst you run all your AI software yeah just keep it minimal close as much as you can i'm using a MacBook M4 that seems to work pretty well with the MacBook Pro but yeah I just I would close multiple windows just keep it all minimal i'm actually going to close Google Anti-gravity now and yeah I I would just avoid like using too much and then also if you're really struggling with coding locally then just switch to coding online instead to use a cloud so for example Bolt Loveable these tools work online and they don't require any sort of firepower from you and your laptop majority of business owners and people at large have no idea how easy this is and how good this technology is right now yeah that's why we created the profit boarding because a lot of people want to use AI they want to learn it but they have no idea where to start they feel intimidated by the power of it right and so that's why we broke everything down into simple systems that work for me so I test everything and then I release the systems online so people can just steal the process from me and yeah that's basically it so thanks very much everyone for watching appreciate as always like I said check out the SEO Black Friday deal and then we have a deal for AI profit boardroom as well so you can save 35% off forever you get uh weekly coaching calls you can jump on this course live ask help ask for advice etc yeah all of my best playbooks for AI and all the best systems that we have and just an awesome community of 1,700 members where you can ask help get advice ask questions and I answer this stuff personally for you as well so feel free to get that link in the comments in description what else we got here mulo says "Do you think Grock 4.1 will prove superior to Gemini 3 over the long run?" I actually don't i tested out Grock 4.1 i just thought this is one of the worst things ever used like it was just it was so bad it was so bad i think Gemini wins by a long way and and Gemini is just superior to everything right now same with Nano Banana nano Banana is superior beer 3 is superior like Google just created the best technologies in the world for all this stuff okay so Google just released something called anti-gravity IDE they just launched the public preview on November 18th 2025 and developers are losing their minds over this here's why this matters every other AI coding tool you've used they help you write code they suggest things but anti-gravity it actually does the work for you like actually does it from start to finish so anti-gravity is what Google calls an agent first IDA that means AI agents are not just helpers they're the main thing these agents are powered by Gemini 3 Pro that's Google's latest and most powerful AI model but here's what's really cool you're not locked into just Google's model anti-gravity also supports Claude Sonnet 4.5 from Anthropic and GPOSS which is an open-source model now there are two main parts to anti-gravity the editor view and the manager view the editor view looks like VS Code you've got your code editor aside panel natural language tasks pretty normal so far but the manager view this is mission control for your AI agents you can spawn multiple agents watch them work see what each one is doing all at the same time it's like having a whole team of developers working for you okay so what can these agents actually do this is the part that blew my mind these agents have access to three things the code editor the terminal and a web browser so imagine this you tell an agent to build a login form the agent writes the code opens the terminal runs the dev server opens a browser actually clicks through your login form takes screenshots and verifies everything works all by itself and it doesn't just do one thing at a time you can have multiple agents running in parallel one agent building the UI another agent writing tests another agent fixing bugs all working together like a real development team now you might be thinking okay this sounds cool but how do I know what the AI is actually doing this is where artifacts come in every time an agent does something it creates artifacts task lists implementation plans screenshots browser recordings everything is documented so you can see exactly what the agent planned exactly what it built nothing is hidden and here's the best part you can leave comments on these artifacts just like Google Docs so if the agent's plan looks wrong you can comment on it and the agent will adjust you're collaborating with the agent but wait it gets even better these agents have memory they remember past tasks they remember code snippets you've used before they remember your feedback and they get better over time so if you ask an agent to do something similar to what you did last week it already knows your style it just does it better and faster real quick before we keep going if you want to scale your business and get more customers you need to check out my AI profit boardroom this is the best place to learn how to use AI strategies and connect with a community of people doing the exact same thing the link is in the description okay back to anti-gravity so how do you actually use this thing first you download anti-gravity it works on Windows Mac and Linux you need at least 8 gigs of RAM but 16 is better then you start a new agent you give it a task in plain English something like build me a simple to-do app the agent breaks it down into steps writes the code opens the terminal launches a dev server opens a browser tests everything takes screenshots and gives you a full report you can watch all of this happen in real time or you can go do something else and check back later you can even spawn multiple agents for bigger projects one agent does research another writes code another handles testing it's like being a CEO of a dev team except all your developers are AI agents so how does this compare to other AI coding tools like Cursor here's the thing cursor is great for code completion it helps you write faster but it doesn't have this multi- aent mission control thing with anti-gravity the agents actually do the work they don't just suggest they execute they plan they verify they work in parallel that's a huge difference now don't get me wrong anti-gravity isn't perfect it's still in public preview there are bugs some people report crashes there are rate limits and you really need to use git because if something goes wrong you might lose your work some Mac users are having login issues and some people hit the rate limits pretty fast especially on big projects google says the limits refresh every 5 hours but if you're doing heavy work you might run into them but here's the thing this is brand new it just launched these issues will get fixed and even with these bugs the potential here is massive let me tell you why this is such a big deal we're moving from AI that helps developers to AI that is developers right now if you want to build something you write the code artificial intelligence helps you go faster but you're still doing the work with anti-gravity you're managing agents you're coordinating work you're reviewing results but the agents are doing the actual building and the browser integration is huge these agents can actually see your app they can click buttons they can fill out forms they can take screenshots and verify things work that's not something most AI tools can do plus the artifact system means you're not flying blind you see everything you understand what's happening and the multi- aent setup means you can tackle way bigger projects so where is this going i think we're going to see more models added more integrations better memory systems more powerful automation and here's what I think is really going to happen the role of a developer is going to change instead of writing every line of code you're going to be managing AI agents reviewing their work setting direction the boring repetitive stuff the agents handle that this frees you up to focus on the creative parts the architecture the big decisions the user experience and honestly that's way more fun anyway now I want to be real with you for a second version control is not optional anymore you need to use Git you need backups because if an agent messes something up you want to be able to roll back second you still need to understand code you can't just blindly trust what the agents do you need to review you need to verify the agents are tools they're not magic third this is a public preview that means it's not finished there will be bugs don't use this for missionritical production stuff yet but even with all that this is still incredible and it's only going to get better from here look the bottom line is this anti-gravity IDE is a big deal it's not perfect it's not finished but it's showing us where we're going and where we're going is a world where AI agents do the heavy lifting and developers focus on the important stuff is it going to replace developers no but it's going to change what being a developer means because the future isn't about writing more code it's about building better things faster so should you try anti-gravity if you're curious about AI and coding absolutely download it play with it see what it can do just remember to use version control and don't trust it blindly and look this is just the beginning google is going to keep improving this other companies are going to build competing tools this whole space is exploding right now and I'm going to keep covering it right before you go I want to tell you about something if you want to learn how to use a II tools like this with Julian Goldie inside you'll get 50 plus free AI tools and 200
