TITLE: How I Vibecode $10,000 FULL Stack Apps (AntiGravity)
ID: 6b38b04b-a9a3-4b69-944a-6f5229af7e6b

anti-gravity has changed everything about building beautiful full stack apps i've personally built software businesses to over $50,000 a month and whilst most tutorials are just theory I'm going to show you my exact system for building and deploying beautiful full stack apps with integrated AI systems that don't fall apart like a $2 suitcase the second the customer uses it so you can build anything without making any costly mistakes and make more money without knowing any coding and if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts i built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers and now I run a 7 figure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in so let's talk about building beautiful UI dashboards and apps with no code and of course we're going to be using Google's anti-gravity to do this now most vibe coded apps it's important that you know this are broken they either look really bad they don't work or they don't really solve a problem but we're going to cover a primma system and it's going to be full stack now I can see the suspicion like well what really is full stack because a lot of people use it but not everybody understands it well it's basically having a front end which is everything to do with what the customer interacts with and also the back end which is the databases and everything that makes the app functional ease way to understand it is the front end is about making it beautiful and the back end is all about functional my previous tech startup we used to look at hiring front-end developers and back-end developers and we would look for full stack developers that could actually work across the entire breadth of the app but the cool news for you is that the recent anti-gravity now does both of those things in one simple application which is why this is so game-changing now as you know Microsoft Word we would use to create documents right excel for spreadsheets anti-gravity is for building software in a very easy way now full stack app we're going to build one but what is it going to include in this video well we're going to include a beautiful front end we want flawless automations that work without us thinking about it we're going to have a connection to a database where we can store all the information and we're also going to deploy this very easily so if you wanted online could do that very quickly now I've always found the best way to do it is to build one together so let's build together now a beautiful dashboard and app and what we're going to build in this video and again this could apply to anything but when you learn the skills of how to build this you can apply it to any idea you've got at all so it's really cool we're going to build an ideas operating system we're going to have a live dashboard with our metrics for our social so YouTube Instagram we're going to have full context on our content so I can chat to any of my videos or any outliers we are going to scrape the internet for viral outliers using Reddit and then we're also going to be able to update our own notion database with actions very easily and then finally of course we're going to connect this to a beautiful database and the framework that we'll use to build this full stack app will apply to any kind of application dashboard website anything you want to build an anti-gravity and I'll link it down below so you can grab that and follow along with the video and it'll work for anything that you want to build so the first to do is open up a brand new folder within anti-gravity and I'm going to call this one I think we'll call this one something like personal OS beautiful okay the name convention doesn't matter too much now what we're going to follow in building this is going to be my anti-gravity blast system it's a very very simple fivestep framework i spent weeks building this and refining it to make the best possible prompt to anti-gravity you can just copy and follow along with it but effectively what we're doing here is we are referring to anti-gravity as a systems pilot and its mission is to build deterministic self-healing automations in anti-gravity using the blast framework which is a blueprint how we connect things to other things architect stylize and trigger protocol and then we're going to use a three layer architecture which is really cool so all you literally do guys with this is come down and I'll update this over time so it's very very cool then head over to anti-gravity and what we need to do first of all is make sure that we've got the planning mode enabled which is really key and we've got Gemini's most powerful model and all you do is you literally paste this in here and what this will happen to anti-gravity now it will create the appropriate file structure and then basically it will take us through a very very simple five-step process to building any fourstep act we want to so we don't have to think about it and this will avoid so many of the mistakes and the pitfalls so the first step of our fivestep framework stands for blueprint this essentially is the logic and what we're doing here is explain to anti-gravity in natural language the exact things that we want so this includes data the source of truth everything that it needs to do that now of all the points in the process this is the most important because the problem that we solve is way more important than how we actually solve the problem so essentially what are we going to be covering well five basic questions you need to know the answer to before you build any false stack app first one is northstar so what is the desired outcome this is always really good on problem to get i wanted to do X what is the thing that you want and it can fill in the gaps if we're not clear we want to know what the external services that we're going to connect to so what are all of the integrations that exist within the app want to know a source of truth so where does a primary data live the delivery payload so how and where should the final result be delivered and then behavior rules so how should the system act terms specific logical constraints etc etc and if it isn't clear it will ask us clarificated questions so this is all about the blueprint division and the logic so if we come back over then to anti-gravity as you can see now this is just initializing all the documents which is awesome and what's great I'll just call it here is that anti-gravity one of the reason I love this as an agentic first kind of building platform is it's already created the blast implementation tasks for us and as it ticks everything off it can come down and it will basically complete that so you can see it's progress so we've given anti-gravity a really clear structured framework and honestly whatever I build now on anti-gravity I use this framework because it just makes it so much easier so you can see it's created gemini project map it's c the delivery structure which is architecture tools and as you can see we've got our tools that can live there with our architecture and we even got our Gemini MD which has everything that's going to be its core reference document for the entire thing now what we need to do is basically answer those discovery questions so we can basically just yap all the stuff we want into here so north star I want a full stack idea operating system that's going to let me think inside a beautiful chatbot discover what's trending save some ideas into permanent system and see real performance metrics we then describe all the integrations so I want one thing to do for the chat interface we can use puppy for that we want to build a scrape from Reddit we want to use superbase for our database or back end i want notion so that I can actually sync things up using the MCP which is going to be cool i'm going to put here using the notion MCP available which is cool also superbase we'll just say again here using the superbase MCP available which I'll touch on in a second which make perfect sense for you and if you're not familiar with MCP by the way just stands for model context protocol it's just a way for anti-gravity to connect to anything and when you connect things via MCPS in this MCP store essentially when it connects to notion it can create pages amend things when it connects to superbase it can do anything i'll get on to that shortly when we get to that point but it's super cool then we have soft source of truth which is going to be superb and then we got the delivery which is going to be the ideation tab an ideas tab a metrics tab and then I want you to be able to save ideas and then we give it some behavior rules about how we want it to be and then we just send that off which is really freaking cool so this is now kind of designed for us the general idea of blueprint so once it's completed that we'll then go on to phase 1b and at this point I also want to start to get a bit of a design reference for anti-gravity so I'm in my community here i'm going to get some of these resources to have a quick look so these are some really beautiful websites you can check out to see what kind of design thing you want the brand guidelines that kind of thing so let's have a look at some of these and then get a little bit of a mood board together of what we'd love our design to look like and fonts and things like that so to do that literally come back to anti-gravity and what you do is right click and open a folder and I want you to call this one sort of design inspiration let's just open this one together we go right click new folder and call this one design inspo sweet and then going to come back over and just basically drop all those files in there so for example on dribble all you do is type in the name of the thing that you want like dashboard you can look down and have a look so I like the idea of this dark mode thing here i think it's really cool i like the way they lay things out and I also like the idea of this one here which is really sweet so we've got all the information there so we're going to save those two images and then what we can do is grab those two images and bring them over into anti-gravity is our inspo and then we're just going to highlight them both like so so command and click and then let's drag them into our inspo section here which is design inspo great beautiful and we can throw it in there and then also let's add another file for like design guidelines so if we can just click on this new file here and we'll call this one design guidelines which is awesome and then let's grab this and also bring this over into design inspo and click on move and then here you can drop in your design guidelines or you can use a tool to look at other different brands to see what you like i've got the brand guidelines here for Collido which is our kind of speechto text startup as you can see so I'm going to add them down below but if you want a good reference point for what brand guidelines should look like I'll also put a link for this down below so you can check it out and use it if you like to but we're just going to control A i'm going to copy all this information like so and then let's go over to anti-gravity and drop in our design guidelines so we come over here and just drop in all the prompts so it knows exactly the kind of reference that I want and then what we can do here as well anti-gravity is say hey and we can say use the and then you do an at sign which will basically pull up anything i can type in the name of the file which is really cool so we've got design inspo is what we want right so design inspo and you can see it's actually found it there it's got three files in it for the dashboard design cool and I'm going to hit enter on that and then click on accept all for the changes and of course you can come through to the implementation plan to see exactly what it plans to do and how it plans to progress and also its task list to see how it's actually progressing so you know exactly where it is step by step as it always goes down and I should also say again this framework will work if you want to build animated websites which is on content on dashboards anything you could possibly imagine full scale apps is the exact same thing so we're going to give it the we're going to agree to this which is cool so that's all working for us nicely in the background i remember with my first tech startup the most important thing I found was resonance with the customer which is to make sure you got a validated demand for the thing that you're building and the biggest coolest concept that I always try to bleed into this content cuz I want to share what worked for me is with a minimal viable product which is basically spending as little money as possible and as little time as possible to validate that person that you're trying to target actually wants to buy your thing you'll save yourself so many things it's like one of the best books I've read as an entrepreneur when I got started was a lean startup it should be like mandatory reading it's so freaking cool and now anti-gravity understands everything about our project our desires our source of truth what we want to do the next thing that we need to do then is give it access to everything and that's why the second step in our blast framework stands for links so link is just connectivity so it's basically testing all the API connections environment credentials and then doing a handshake in other words making sure it can actually connect and communicate with all of them before it goes ahead and actually builds the thing for us so what I recommend that you do with any project that's getting larger and literally I tried to make this a little bit complicated just to show you how easy it actually is is we want an integrations list so here are all the things that we're going to need to make our personal operating system for ideas and our content we've got Reddit and YouTube now anti-gravity should itself be able to scrape Reddit just create scripted for us and also YouTube I'm pretty sure but if not we can do an API with that then we have MCP so since we've got a big beautiful tick on those guys we can move over to the MCP section so let's go with an anti-gra now and take a look at this now the first question I always ask with any integration is do they got an MCP for that because if they do it makes our life so much easier you check your MCPS these dots up here come down to MCP servers now anti-gravity has an inbuilt store of about 20 different MCPS you know there's things in here for example like notion which is a great one you type in notion you click on notion it pops up here which is great you click on configure and then all you do is click on notion token like so this will open up a brand new page all you're going to do here is create a brand new integration come down give it a name like personal OS we click the workspace internal is fine and click on save this will now create a brand new integration for us which is awesome and what it'll do is give us a token all we're going to do then once we've done that is click on configure integration settings you're going to show this you're going to copy that going to come back over to anti-gravity and enter it into your notion API token list and then crucially the way that notion works as I always say is that you have to enable it on the page so say for example we want to create a brand new page which I'll do over here i've got a new page here i'm just call this one Jack's content ideas okay so what you do is you click on the butts here you're going to come down here to connections and as you can see if I type in personal OS it's now connected that's how you do it but I'm going to connect it to my typical one which is this anti-gravity one here and now essentially what this means is anti-gravity has full access to this notion it can create pages it can edit it can do anything you want to so step one as always is there an MCP for that i also did a post covering this MCP marketplace which I'll show you which is a really cool place to grab this i'll put this link down below for you as well so if you're looking for inspiration of what can I connect check it out here and you can look down there the other thing you can do is just go to Gemini or track GBT and say hey what is the MCP config for this and you can find it like that so we've enabled notion which is awesome and by the way you can see all of this if you click on manage MCP servers and it will load up now and it'll show all of the MCP servers that are live so I've got Fireflies NAN notion pine cone superbase and versal which is cool so we also want the superbase one which is great so let's just check if it's natively integrated and it is awesome so I'll show you how you connect that real quick you click on this once again it's configure and it's looking for an access token you just click on superb base access token like so opens up a page like this all you're going to do is just generate a new token call this whatever you want to expires and we'll say it expires 1 hour we'll put it on the clock and obviously it means it just stops working after an hour and then we'll get a code and literally all you do is come down here basically you can just copy the code right here from this picture here come back over to anti-gravity and enter it in and then superbase will be fully enabled little hack by the way with your MCP servers is you don't want the total number of tools to go too far above 50 just for the context window now if you're looking for an MCP that does not exist so for example I have Fireflies here right that basically grabs all of my meeting transcripts lets me find what my actions were loads of cool stuff and if I type in here what you'll see is it doesn't exist but there's a way around that and I'll show you this is how it works for anything so for example if I just shoot over to Gemini and I'm going to show you what all these apps do in a second by the way just so you can use them i might say something like "Hey dude what is the M?" Just say MCP config right the MCP configuration the and fire flies that's it okay okay and what it will do is just give you the code that you can now enter into anti-gravity meaning you can connect to literally everything at some point anti-gravity will make it really easy with a click and installation but until that point you can just ask AI to find it for you you can see it's right there so all you literally do is you copy this for example then you head back over to anti-gravity and essentially you come back to the agent and you say something like "Hey dude add the blow to my MCP config." Cuz that's the name of the file okay you pop that in and you see it says your API key there you will just go over to the service so for example an example of Fireflies i'll show what that looks like just so I just want to make sure that you all the details so you can really follow along across this so in the case of Firefly for example settings developer settings grab your API key head back over replace this API key here and then all you do is click on view raw config you'll have all the data there just arr come down here and I'm just going to say add it to the below enter in all the information and then anti-gravity will give you the updated MCB config you come over here you control A you delete all of it you paste and then you come down you click file click save and then once you've done that and you head over to your MCB config MCB servers you'll actually then see it enabled once you've hit the refresh button so I'm going to say don't save cuz I deleted everything here but once you hit this refresh button any tools that you just added will be there invisible and this basically is to connect anti-gravity to anything and so now we've covered every integration i now want to show you how you actually integrate an API with anti-gravity and the example we're going to use in this video is going to be Poppy AI which is a really cool software and actually used by loads and loads of top creators as you'll see how we're going to integrate it so you're going to head over we're going to log into this one and obviously you can build anything in anti-gravity this does make it very easy so what we're going to do on the left hand side is essentially we can copy and paste any knowledge so what I kind of want to do here very easily I'd think of Poppy as it's like Canva plus AI in many respects that and it's best explained by an example so for example I'm on my YouTube channel here what I want to be able to do with our new AI system is actually understand everything about my videos my intros any context and I can do this with any video right so I can literally right click on this one here so say I copy clean link i head over to copy and I can control V and paste it in right so let me show what I mean with this so let's come over here and let's build this one out together and then connect it to anti-gravity so let's come down and create a group so a group is a series of things that we're going to be using so in this instance what I want is one group of let's say my last five videos so come down here let's copy this one here and what we can do with this is drop all in like so and then you can actually then chat with these as an AI about the entire transcript if you drop in short form content one of the things it can do at the moment is actually understand frame by frame what's going on so I think like one of the biggest short form creators on the planet uses this as I understand to build like all scripts so that's like one of the coolest use cases for this is like building out like content ideas and scripts and since we're building out a personal OS this is going to be so sick so I've got down here animated websites really cool so basically any information that you want to you can simply come down here come and grab there we go beautiful and you can drop in text or anything you want to so we're going to call this one here for for instance i'm going to call this one Jacks okay videos awesome and then what we should do is connect this to an AI so once we've added in everything to power our personal OS let's come side and add in now a model so cool thing about this is we can actually pick any the models we want to so I think we should go ahead with the wonderful claw 4.5 let's connect these two together real quick beautiful so you can pick the model down here i think we'll go with one of 4.5 is fine so let's ask a question hey dude give me the intros for all of my videos bam just like that and we'll see what this can do so this should be able to understand the intros of all 12 videos if it does that it'd be very very freaking cool so I'll track the interesting videos however beautiful $10,000 websites and you can see that's the intro once I 10 do these five things immediately that's the intro so now we can essentially just like nobug LM chat to all these things in a beautiful interface and get some a stuff now the second thing I want to add into this actually is going to be what I would call the hooks generator so when you're creating short form content at all one of the most important things just like YouTube the intro is going to be the hooks so let's come down add another one and I think what I want to call this one is very simply we call this one viral hooks and then why don't we head over to YouTube and grab some examples of that so we got a cool video here by Callaway why don't we copy this and again you could basically if you think of this as your brain just grab all the resources that you want to fill out this stuff so we're going to drop this one down here and then I'm also going to add in a file as well so let's upload something and you can do that by clicking document on the left hand side and just click on drop files here or just upload from device and one of the ones I've had here is this 1,00 barrel hooks by PBL which is cool which is basically just hooks to everything these are viral tested so these all work on all platforms which should be pretty handy for the personal OS that we're building so we've added that in as you can see we've put it there now what's cool is we're going to want to give the AI something to note so if I come down here and I give it a note say "Hey at any time you are asked uh for a hook grab three examples from this." and adapt them to the topic at hand and we'll say provide the initial example and the one you created cool and then I think let's give this as well a little bit of a note just say hey use this for best practices on creating hooks for short for content cool sweet i think it's really So now we've got our two resources what we can do is now connect these ones together so we also just want to make sure that it works before we actually validate it and throw it into our scenario so this ones up together beautiful and we've gotten all of the information out from this chat window which is cool and great you know you can ask it these kinds of questions let's ask a question like "Hey create me I don't know three hooks for my video on AI design masterass for short form content." Make sure this one works and when we're happy with it then we can actually connect it into anti-gravity to complete the full step which is going to be crazy and then if we come down and take a look at this we've got different options here so this one here is okay everyone told you to learn Figma and high expense designers but here's the thing and the inspiration is everyone tells you to do insert action but no one tells you to do it cool then we got this one here this design system cost $10,000 and this one 10K and then here's the original inspiration and blah blah blah you're not about to design you're not uncreative and it gives you the examples awesome very very very cool so now we got this set up question is how the hell do we actually access it into our wonderful anti-gravity well let's come down here and click on So we can do a chatbot so if we did a chatbot and called this one social OS whatever it is and create chatbot description I'm just add a random description you could use this as a chatbot right which is cool so I can view this chatbot blah blah blah have it in a window have conversations with it and just chat with our stuff but what I would prefer to do and I think it's going to take this a million times better is actually connect it now so we're going to click on this we're going to head over here and we click on API and what's cool is we're looking for post which is cool and it's given us all the information that we need down here which is a chat link as well as the request body preview so we feed these two things to anti-gravity it'll know exactly what it's doing and again knowing how to do this with this API you can use it for anything and it means that you are essentially unstoppable with anti-gravity so we're going to copy this one let's scroll down now and head back to anti-gravity and then we're going to give it now all of the information it needs to essentially know what we're connecting to cool so anti-gravity so let's give it and of course we're going to use our speech to text glider to kick some butt with this stuff hey dude you have a notion and a superbase MCP so use both of those credentials to access and do the updates with those two things with notion for example I want the ability to add things to my to-do list now for Poppy um this is going to be the brain behind the chatbot i want you to build a beautiful and gorgeous WhatsApp style chat interface and whenever I send a message you're going to send that message to the Poppy endpoint which I will provide for you down below and then for Reddit to scrape I expect you to build a scraper that can pull for me let's say the top 10 posts from the r/ singularity subreddit and the r/natn subreddit in addition to that when it comes down to YouTube I expect you to be able to grab my current subscriber numbers and the same for Instagram if you are unable to do this please let me know and then guys we just post in our Poppy information like that so I'm gonna say Poppy API which is cool and we enter the creds so we've added in that let's come back and just make sure we get the body request preview which is this i'm going to come back over and then paste that there and then we are ready to rock and roll beautiful and just like that it's validated all five connections we've got the Poppy API awesome notion MCP Superbase MCP Instagram's connected as well as YouTube's now ready to rock and roll and proceed with the next step so we're going to say hey go ahead with a big exclamation mark perfect and now anti-gravity has got all the links and connects it needs to make the app possible that takes us very nicely on to the third step of our blast framework which stands for architecture so this is actually the bit now where anti-gravity goes and builds us the thing to get it production ready it's validated that it can access all the endpoints now it's ready to build our beautiful application and within phase three we've got a couple of things so we're going to operate within a three layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability llms are probabilistic whereas business logic must be deterministic in a sense that if you ask a language model the same question 100 times you get 100 different answers but when we're building our dashboard we need them to behave in a very predictable deterministic way and this is how we accomplish this with an anti-gravity so lay one is the architecture which is technical SOPs written in markdown define goals inputs tool logic and edge cases and the golden rule if the logic changes we must update the SOP before updating any of the code then we've got navigation which is the decision-making so this is your reasoning layer you root between the SOPs and the tools you do not try to perform complex tasks yourself you call execution tools in the right order and finally under the tools is deterministic Python scripts atomic and testable and environment variables that are stored inv so with that in mind let's go ahead now and check on anti-gravity see how it is getting on in our environment so it's already working in the background and building everything within phase 3 architecture which is great and I love that anti-gravity has built this kind of artifact for us to clearly check how it's getting on with all of our prescribed actions beautiful and then once Gemini has completed building it we can now check it out for ourselves to make sure that it's functional then we can move on to design steps and one of the things I want to call out as well is that you want to be aware of what's called context rot so if you imagine the context window these models is say 200,000 tokens the first 100,000 tokens can do anything it's like you at 9:00 in the morning you're ready to rock and roll you're kicking butt but the second 100,000 is like when it's like 11:55 you've not eaten in 6 hours so once it's done a task come over and click this plus button and get a brand new chat and it'll be a lot more effective when it does that so that out of the way let's go check now the local host let's go check out what it looks like so we can literally just copy this or hit the button but we're going to head over now to a random website and check this one out so look host 3000 so this is actually captured if you think about it Glido's branding down to a te so for instance if I show you Glido can you see the black and the white and the kind of like the way this all fits together your river logos those cool things there's me yapping on the video talking about Glider having a good time in the studio so you get that it's actually covered the brief perfectly which is really freaking cool and it's quite minimalistic and edgy so let's check now the chat window works so again we're talking to Poppy so let's ask it a question about my video for example so why don't we ask it a question about the new bull let's ask a random question about Gemini hey dude could you give me a random fact about anti-gravity that people may not know based on the videos that you have okay bam we send that one off let's have a look i've got a random profile photo which is funny we can maybe add that as a feature like "Hey let me upload my own photo so I can get myself that." In fact let's do that right now while we're here let's come back over and just say "Hey dude I would love you to add the feature for me to upload my own photo as my profile photo in my chat window." And then let's actually just save that photo in Superbase thank you okay beautiful send that one off and it can do that and again this why superbase is so cool it's like Microsoft Excel on storage hey yeah I'm here here's a random fact people don't know and craft product agent simultaneously well most people use like a single chatbot you can actually have five six seven agents then if I open up my discovery section check this out guys i now have all the top posts from Nitn as I requested that's now doing cuz it's doing some work in the background it'll open the browser and do various different things which is cool so my own UI agency automation so if I was making N content for example I could use this to do this and again this can scrape any subreddit so Reddit is supposed to be the front page of the internet it's a great place to get ideas so you get the idea i could filter by new by heart i could do anything i didn't need to do any API connections for this at all i just told anti grabby to do it and it did it so let's see if this takes me to the article i click on the link and we'll see if this opens up in Reddit and it does indeed there you go there's the image so it's actually visually engaging and what I can do now is actually save this you see so if I come on to save I have nothing so I want the ability to save various different things I like i come to discovery let's come back and let's say that I really want to save this one here so I click save which is cool it said it's saved awesome if I come over to save now do I see it i do it's a trend very cool so if I refresh it now am I going to physically see it and I do and it's literally saved it now because it's in our Superbase and how freaking incredible is that and then we got the metrics down below and performance which has my YouTube channel and then also my Instagram which is freaking amazing so from a functionality point of view this is hitting the mark on everything I said now you can imagine how you can build this up i basically just described something followed the fivestep blast framework and it's built it so you can see whatever the thing is you're trying to build you can do this now and crucially guys it's now connected to Superbase with all our databases so let me show you exactly what's happening in Superbase the way I want you to think about Superbase is like Microsoft Excel kind of on steroids what we need with any fullstack app is a comprehensive backend an alternative to this is what we call Firebase which is cool you can use either i personally I just really like Superbase i like its interface now it can look a little bit intimidating to get started but don't let that put you off so if I come over down here to projects we got stock 500 which is the one that is built in but bear in mind because I given access to anti-gravity MCP I haven't had to touch a single thing in Superbase so technically speaking this entire thing could be in Japanese it wouldn't make a single difference to us because we haven't had to mess around with it for the purpose of this you come down side to database on the left hand side and you can see all these different schema visualizers YouTube trends it's got all this beautiful stuff and you can actually physically see this if you click into tables that said Superbase is a skill that's worth investing into now I'm a big believer in keeping the number of technologies that you learn very small i like few few platforms stretch their maximum potential and realistically you need you need a database right you need a place to store customers that are buying your stuff or your data or the things that we're saving in our applications we need a database so we have to be familiar with a database and I think the the actual MCP integration to get with anti-gravity is a beautiful and wonderful way to actually start this out now this itself has said hey I've now done the changes which is cool it's got a backend create an advertised bucket now Superbase doesn't just store data numbers and this is the cool thing right you know let's say you and I run a business together and let's say we have a subscription business for our whatever app right i don't know our coffee app or something we can actually query superbase or like this will do it for us in what's called SQL which basically you and I speak English table speak SQL and it can give you stuff like averages like hey how many what's the average trend line what's our churn rate what's our ARO you can ask it all these kinds of great questions so this is now saying that it's done so why don't we head back over now to the local host and check out to see what that physically looks like so let's go over to our local host which I think is on this one so if I was to refresh this page do we now have the ability to upload profile photos so we come over to the website and we don't actually quite see that ability so let's actually ask it now to create a setting section for us cool so just come over and say "Hey create a setting section and let me display that on the sidebar." And then the other feature I want to add actually thinking about it is I want the ability to get the article content from let's say that subreddit so I also would love the ability to have a copy button for the article content from the subreddit and also in the save section I'd like the saved view of the Reddit article to look just like it does in the scrape section for me please now one of the reasons why I'm asking it to do that is cuz if I want to feed that into let's say our YouTube AI superpower agent that we built in Poppy AI it wouldn't it be great if I could say "Hey here's the article give me some ideas that would fit my YouTube channel or like based on my content style or explain this my tone of voice." You get the idea and the thing I want to call out here as well just accept all and come back over here for a second the thing with this Poppy thing is really freaking cool right because you can also do it with text so for example you could get loads of research from let's say Gemini does a big research report and you can drop it in so for instance if I'm on Glider website I could copy all the text and I come over to Poppy and I just controlV this is now the text about Glad so I could I might like just say down here and just like if I drop this into the viral hook section we wouldn't keep it in the viral hook section you get the idea but the point is that you could have it there if you physically wanted to right which is cool now it can speak about everything the other thing I may want to do just to make this really freaking cool actually so let me come ahead and delete this one is we can add in a prompt which is really cool so let's come over here and just move the Jack's videos over here real quick and then let's add something in so we can record as our voice for example yep we're happy with that let's click on this hey dude one of the things I'd like you to do if you're asked any questions about Jack's content Jack's video I'd like you to use the Jack's videos tab and then if you've got asked any questions about hooks or short form content I'd like you to use the viral hooks tab awesome so now I have this audio which is really cool and this can serve as a prompt for the model so we're going to come down here and then why don't we just grab this and connect it and then we have something here hey read this and knowing exactly what to consult when looking at information okay beautiful and just like that it looks like it has completed and it's checking so let's come over now and check on our local host so this is the one that it's using to build out all the things but if I come over to our vision local host and see if that has been updated and guys we this got Jackarot's profile down at the bottom which is cool so if I click on settings which is cool here's a profile photo i don't know who this guy is who knows who this guy is dude what's he doing on the Jack Robbers YouTube channel so just come down here and click on this photo all right I've selected my profile photo see if this uploads real quick and we should be ready to rock and roll and there we go i'm now live and ready and cool and having a good time which is decent so if I click off this if I click on performance come thinking i'm going to say "Hey there what is my latest video?" Random question send that one off and you can see it is now reflected there also and you can also amend it there but you get the idea how this is customizable right so when we build this out for a custom dashboard to sign in you can do a million things and so now we've got the functionality that we're happy with in whatever fullstrap act that we've got right we've got a front end we've got a back end we've got a database we've got logic and automation which we built in this in this process the next step the fourth step in our blast framework stands for stylize and this is the bit where we take the design and the front end from this to this and to do this I like doing something called UI sniping and the idea of UI sniping I'm going to publish this post up from the community so helpful so we got this 21st step thing and then my buddy my main man Max has dropped us with all of these beautiful examples of things that you can use so the idea is we go to these libraries these components and we find things that we think look really cool like this is a great one 21st and on the left hand side you'll see you can basically search for anything so I've got borders here i can do shide borders we got border beam we've got stuff for clients honestly it's like being a kid in a candy store that's how it sort of feels so you got all this cool stuff if you've got footers and you literally just pick the thing that you want to have and then go and grab it ai chat is a really cool one and essentially what we do I mean this is actually really nice to be honest with you i really like this one and send that one off what does it do okay it's just like a basic chat see most of the internet are not reinventing these components you know they're kind of like just using existing things that are already there so you can pick all the stuff that you want on the left hand side and just go through all the different components this is another example i mean this is a really cool disc website actually i love how they do this so go around have a quick look i'll put some links down below so you can just click the buttons and find the stuff that you like and this is really cool one I want to put on your radar as well is actually code pen they're really cool so if I type in I think it was chat this one is really cool it's like a convers okay this one's really nice so this is a cool daily UI one so for example you could come on something like this and say hey blah blah blah so say we liked this design as a for instance what I could do is come back over to anti-gravity which is chilling out down here on my screen i'm going to say awesome dude now let's move to phase four to stylization i want to do a full restylization guide and I would like you to add to completely remodel the chat window with again keep the avatars but add the below code to do it up and then I also want to improve the features and the design of the entire app generally okay so I've given it like a hey do like a general thing but then what I'm going to do as well is come over and grab some of the code then from this and all we're going to do is just copy this and we just paste in the code bam that's one just copy this one come back over here this is two and then come back over grab this and this is three so huge huge shout out to the individual sharing this code let's give them their props come down and find out who it was but you basically get the idea here there you go they're on the suffer funk what an absolute legend cool person so you get the idea now you basically UI snipe so then what we essentially do is look at our application think cool well what do I kind of want to change well I maybe I want a little bit of contrast on this page so then you do step by step you say screenshot you like cool I want to add more contrast on this and you just step by step step excuse me I get emotional thinking about this stuff go down and improve it it is very minimalistic and it follows some really nice basic stuff which I think is really tasty but effectively you're connected now to the database connected to everything and now it's just about making my design look fantastic and just like that we've got this beautiful design back from anti-gravity look at this we have these little individual conversation starters i could say I want to brainstorm hooks i can click on send i can embarrass different things and look at that highlight guys look at that attention to detail and again we can UI snipe and change every bit of detail if we wanted to move it in anyway we can just tell anti-gravity i'll click send on this you can see it's bumping he's having a good thing and of course I can then come down and check out everything on the left like discovery where I can basically go ahead and scrape and get various different things i've got all the things I have in the save section i've got my performance i've got essentially everything that I want him which is awesome there you go look at this trend coming back discovery popping back everything that we need and of course all this is going back over to Poppy our beautiful AI brain engine which of course you can just chat on Poppy it's very very cool if you want to so once we've completed all the design components and we're very happy with the look and feel we've grabbed different components from different websites and we think it's amazing leads us very nicely onto the fifth step of our five-step framework which stands for deploy now why would we use deployments well there's a couple of different ideas based on your use case so for instance if we just want to use this IMLA host as our own personal ideiation operating system we don't really need to deploy it anywhere but maybe you want to have it with your team or maybe you're selling it to customers or maybe have clients there are many different reasons but the other thing that sits within deploy which is really interesting is the scraper so we could have if we wanted to what if we want the scraper to run every single day in the background what if we're scraping YouTube and Instagram and Reddit and LinkedIn and Instagram and many different sources or we're scraping leads but we don't want to have to keep re-triggering it all that is solved in the fifth step and as you can see in phase five we've got cloud transfer so where are we sending to automation so setting up automation triggers documentation and then we've got of course operating principles which we gave to anti-gravity at the beginning which is the data first rule selfing repair loop deliverables for intermediates and of course the file struct that we gave it so what we're going to use for this is something called modal so what I propose that we do with this is just as a for instance you can see how we've got this discovery thing here and we're running the scraper what I would like to do is set it up so that the scraper runs every single day automatically and that the images and assets here just stay static and then when something new is added it adds and when it isn't we can remove it so how would we actually physically do that i mean what if we're at the gym or our laptop's closed well let me show you what we're going to do is we need a platform to host on and we're going to be using modal.com which is a really great as I say it's AI infrastructure the developers love what I really love is this on the homepage i keep clicking this button and this does crazy stuff but look if you head over to the dashboard now it's very very cool now check this out what I want to do is click on quick start guide like so right and what you're going to do here basically is you're going to come and copy this and then going to head over to anti-gravity and we're going to create a brand new chat window and we're going to have a cool conversation here cool so what I'm going to say to it is a block which is hey there dude happy with the design we can now move on to phase five what I would like to happen now is the Reddit scraper to scrape once a day i want to write a script for that and when it's done it scraping I want you to save all of the information within Superbase so that you don't have to rescrape it then when it rescrapes and refires if there are new top articles add them and if there are no new top articles or it's the same article don't create duplicates just leave it as it is and on top of that I want the ability to delete and remove and I want this to run every day and I expect this to run on modal with the below code awesome all right I'm going to come down and then we're going to enter in that code and then we basically send it off and then anti-gravity can start working its magic and after you've given anti-gravity that code it will actually open up modal.com and a token flip and all you do is going to come down and click authorize and if for whatever reason it doesn't do this just tell anti-gravity hey usually you open up and I just click a one click on a browse to my tokens do that please and then when you head over to modal you can actually see that it's there and ready to run in the next 4 hours and 43 minutes and then we come back and say "Hey dude that's all complete fantastic and now it's done." Now obviously if you wanted to publish this online to Versell we can do that now Versell is very very cool essentially the way that it works is we publish the thing to GitHub okay and then from GitHub we then publish it to Vel so what do GitHub we come over we click on new cuz GitHub is just a place that takes all that cool code that you built and then puts it online so I can come down here and I could call this one something like let's call this one like personal OS now if it's just for your personal use you don't need to do this but if you're building an app this is what it is and we give it a description like personal OS which is cool come down and create repository i'm going to make it public for the time being but then I can make it private afterwards cuz we connect via token then all you do is come down and click this copy come back over and say "Hey dude I'd like you to commit all the files to GitHub and do any changes or checks or anything like that to make sure that it is fully hosted on GitHub and is all sorted out okay beautiful send one off we accept all and then we're going to give it the GitHub link like so which is awesome." And then bring in we'll just full screen this guy right here wonderful and if by magic it's done it which is great and all we now do is click this button like so and what's happened well if I come up here you can see basically it's now these are all of our wonderful files that exist and then what we need to do is head over to Visel now Visell is just somewhere where we host the stuff so you just connect this to GitHub and remember GitHub is just a place where we store files that's all it is it's called a repo repository sounds a bit fancy when you first learn it but honestly it's just a place where they put documents there's nothing more complicated to it than that like TMP most people like what the hell does that mean you know it's honestly it's it's just all coden files that's all it is so look we're over here now all you're going to do is click on add new add new project and you're going to see personal OS so we click on import which is cool now this typically dynamically identifies the framework presets so you don't need to worry about this i'll also show you by the way how you get a personal domain if you want to super cool and all we do is just click on well we got environment variables which is cool which actually we don't even need to mess around with and we click deploy so this is a great opportunity to explain environment variables so let's say that you deploy an app that needs chat GPT or Gemini or Claude in it or maybe it connects to Superbase and loads of things you might be wondering well how do I connect to this in a way that doesn't expose me well the idea is that we can use these environment variables so we hardcode those into VUL so they're not publicly exposed ever which means that they're secure which is super cool so what we're going to do now as you can see we click on this we open up and it says 404 not found and I'm so glad this happened cuz I can show you how you troubleshoot so check this out you right click you go to inspect right you can see all the code and what's happened here so you have this little X we click on this guy and let's have a look so fail to live resource the server responded with status four or four oh my goodness all we're going to do is control 5 come over and actually I think the reason why this has failed is because we haven't configured our environment variables i think that's exactly what's happened here so let me show you something really cool okay come down here options click on clipboard now I'm going to head over to anti-gravity i'm going to paste in this and I want you to come to these dots and I want you to go to MCP servers and I want you to type in the cell which should be available there okay you don't see it that's cool so just like I showed you before you're going to head over to JGBT or Gemini we'll do that right now and then we just say something like "Hey there man what is the MCP config for Versell?" Sweet and then Gemini will give us the MCP config for Vel and just like before you're going to head over to Vel you're going to go and grab your API token if you haven't got that already so let's come ahead and grab that so the address is val.com/account/settings/ tokens and all you do is create a brand new token just call this one something like blah blah blah blah actually oops not in the scope we don't need that click all this stuff i come down to full account and expiration date however comfortable you are with the expiration date I'll just put a day for example click on create and then you've got the access token then you copy it put that to one side beautiful i'll just delete this right now it's always best practice to delete all all these codes but you can see I've got one in there from earlier and then on Gemini you can see have we got the Vessel we do cool so this is the endpoint which is cool so we do copy this and just like I showed you earlier in the video we're going to do the exact same process okay I did it earlier which is why you can see at the moment I have Vel right here which is cool but here's one thing you're going to find out guys it's got 150 different configurations which is obscene so just in the ones that I use I use Vellless Projects i use number six i use 12 13 14 15 and then I also use I think that might be all of them actually there 146 147 148 149 these are the ones that I find helpful the way that I came to the determination by the way I basically worked it through his AI about all the stuff I expect to do and it reduced it cuz if you don't reduce that down like it's going to like you're going to run into a lot of problems cuz 100 is where you want to be we need to enable it which we have and I'm going to just disenable motion for a second which is cool so I'm going to come back over to manage MCP servers let's go back to the agent and I'm going to say "Hey dude it's failed." And I believe that's because it doesn't have the environmental variables configured you have access to a VEL MCP i would like you to use that MCP to put in all of those environmental variables for me and fix it awesome and what I'm going to do is just send that one off and let it work as background and honestly the VLE MCP is wonderful because you it can really do so much for you though which is so awesome like all the environmental variables like copying this API key that AP it's like a FAF and it just enables it to just run forward and do it wonderful things as you can see now MCP tools VLE project it's like I'm going to find the project and it knows the project because we just put it to GitHub right now whenever I make any changes to this ever what will happen is this will update GitHub and then because Vel is just a mirror of GitHub it's like kind of like the expression of G that's the code this is what the code gives you that's what it that's all it is so when we update the code the cell changes instantaneously which is cool and just like that it has now officially completed it so I've added the missing environment variables to for Superbase which is awesome to make sure these changes take effect I pushed a small update repository to automatically trigger a new deployment to Vel wait a moment and then come check it out all right cool well let's go back and we'll wait a moment let's click on it and see if it's now loaded and just like that guys anti-gravity has now pushed this live to Vel for us because it's connected via MCP so all I can do is click on this now as you can see and now we have the beautiful app the personal operating system.app and I can change the domain for this or do anything I want to i've got discovery i've got my save stuff which connected to my superbase i've got my performance of course haven't saved anything yet with the refresh superbase i've got everything that I want in the app which is freaking crazy i've even got this progress target to 100,000 subscribers and also Instagram which is freaking awesome so how do I change the domain with this well one of the things that you can do with this right you continue down to your dashboard here let's have a quick look and then what we can do here is have basically this is where you can edit your entire app it has all these different functions it has your deployments your analytics speed insights you can check everything that's happening here you can even manage storage it's kind of think of this like your WordPress interface basically we can manage anything that you need to but specifically for us we want to click on this domains thing here because this is where you can manage domains and all you do is come down and buy domain and you can say "Hey I like uh let's just say glidoiscool.com right glidos speech to text we love it glidiscool.com i don't know $3.99 whatever you want to buy we can literally come down here we can add it and by the way this is the exact same process you proceed down to the checkout you purchase it and then you can enable it it's the same thing that I did when I purchased scalewithted.com which I built with anti-gravity GitHub and Versel this exact website guys is all built and if I make any changes anti-gravity this reflects like how freaking cool is that and it's the same thing with I think it's ideas with Jack you can see it's Versel redirects to ideas with Jack really simple very very very cool and then we've also got the thing now running for us on Modal which will fire off the automation for us instantaneously and so now we've covered exactly how to build these full stack apps in anti-gravity if you want to take it one step further and learn the exact systems that I use to scale my own business and I've helped hundreds of businesses do it you want to know the systems the blueprints all the technology because what I share on YouTube is just a fraction of what I have inside my community so if you want to take to X next level you can do that by clicking the link at the top of the description
