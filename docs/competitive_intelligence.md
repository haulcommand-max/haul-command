# Haul Command: Competitive Intelligence & Kill Strategy

## The Battlefield

Oversize permit services = process + data + compliance businesses.
Not heavy infrastructure. **VERY disruptable with automation.**

No platform owns the ecosystem yet. That is the opening.

## Market Structure: Two Buyer Types

| Segment | Wants | Current Provider Style | Haul Command Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fleets** | Centralized admin, stored vehicle data, compliance handling, payment integration | Enterprise portals (Comdata) | AI auto-fill + predictive permitting + integrated payments |
| **Owner-Operators** | Speed, human access, simple ordering, relationship | High-touch agents (WCS) | Instant AI quoting + 24/7 availability + human escalation for complex moves |

## Competitor Kill Matrix

### Tier 1 — Enterprise (Hardest to Displace)

#### Comdata
| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | 500+ permit types, 48 states, Canada |
| **Scale Signal** | 250,000+ permits in 2022, Bestpass partnership |
| **Strength** | One-stop shop: permits, licensing, pilot cars, tax. 24/7 portal. |
| **Weakness** | "Salesforce problem" — powerful but not loved. Slow-moving enterprise. Not specialized for extreme heavy haul. |
| **Kill Vector** | Speed + specialization. They serve everyone; you OWN heavy haul. Predictive permitting is a feature they won't build for 3+ years. |

#### WCS Permits & Pilot Cars
| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | U.S. and Canada |
| **Scale Signal** | Largest privately owned OS permit company in North America. Largest pilot-car network. 75+ agents with 10yr avg experience. |
| **Strength** | Relationship fortress. Logistics consulting + route surveys. |
| **Weakness** | Human-heavy model = hard to scale. High labor costs. Slow automation adoption. |
| **Kill Vector** | **Companies built on people are vulnerable to AI.** Your predictive routing replaces their route surveys. Your AI replaces their 75 agents for standard permits. Their 10yr experience becomes your training data. |

### Tier 2 — Strong but Not Dominant

#### On The Move Permits
| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | All 50 states + Canada |
| **Scale Signal** | 1,000,000+ permits completed. 30+ years. |
| **Strength** | Trusted and proven. Volume credibility. |
| **Weakness** | **Still uses email/fax workflows.** Fax = disruption signal. |
| **Kill Vector** | Easiest displacement. Their differentiator is experience alone. Experience loses to speed + automation + predictive routing every time. |

#### NAPS (North American Permit Service)
| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | All 50 states + Canada |
| **Scale Signal** | 50 years of heavy-haul experience. |
| **Strength** | Credibility + deep knowledge. Route planning + compliance guidance. |
| **Weakness** | Traditional service model. No visible tech positioning. |
| **Kill Vector** | Classic "legacy operator." Their knowledge becomes your database. Your AI delivers their 50 years of experience in milliseconds. |

---

### Tier 3 — Mid-Market

#### Axys Permits
| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | 48 states + Canada |
| **Scale Signal** | Mid-tier brand awareness. |
| **Strength** | Digital route surveys + regulatory services. Lean and modern. |
| **Weakness** | No massive scale signal. |
| **Kill Vector** | Outrun them with technology. They're doing digital route surveys; you're doing predictive AI route feasibility. Different league. |

## Where The Real Margins Are

Most people see paperwork. The actual profit layers:

### 1. Compliance Abstraction (Fear = Pricing Power)
Carriers pay to avoid fines and delays. Mis-reported dimensions or misunderstood provisions trigger penalties fast.

### 2. Data Reuse (Margins Expand Over Time)
Once vehicle data is stored, the next permit is cheaper to process. Every subsequent transaction has higher margin.

### 3. Bundling (The Margin Strategy)
Stack: permits + pilot cars + route surveys + tax/IRP + compliance.
Comdata positions as "single source for all permit needs." **That is what we're building with the Hyper-OS.**

## Haul Command vs. The Field

| Capability | Comdata | WCS | On The Move | NAPS | Axys | **Haul Command** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Predictive permitting | No | No | No | No | No | **YES (Built)** |
| AI route feasibility | No | No | No | No | Partial | **YES (Built)** |
| Instant cost estimate | No | No | No | No | No | **YES (Built)** |
| Auto-fill vehicle profiles | Yes | No | No | No | No | **Building Now** |
| Multi-state rule engine | Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual | **Automated (5 states, expanding)** |
| Bridge clearance database | No | Survey-based | No | Manual | Digital | **Automated + Scored** |
| Fax/email ordering | No | No | **Yes** | Likely | No | **Never** |

## The Kill Shot (We Already Have It)

> **Predictive permitting: Permit feasibility BEFORE freight is accepted.**
> Almost nobody does this. We already built it.

Legacy model: "Order permit after load booked"
Haul Command: "Know if the load is even moveable BEFORE you commit"

**We are part of freight decisioning. They are part of paperwork.**

## Priority Targets for Displacement

1. **On The Move** — Fax workflows. Experience-only differentiator. Easiest kill.
2. **NAPS** — Legacy operator. 50 years of knowledge that becomes our training data.
3. **Axys** — They're trying to be modern but can't match AI speed. Outrun them.
4. **WCS** — The relationship fortress falls when AI is faster AND smarter than their 75 agents.
5. **Comdata** — Don't attack head-on. Specialize in heavy haul where they generalize. Take the niche, then expand.
