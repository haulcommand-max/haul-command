A month or so ago, I shared the beginning results of an ad I was running. I decided to give you an update! I shared the real results of this Facebook Lead Ad below. But, since I also get the question, "Are your leads good quality?", I decided to also share the results of the bulk verification of all of these leads.Gone are the days where beginners or non experts can run their own ads successfully, thanks to Plai

Plai has really changed our business for the better. Having all ad platforms in one place is so much better than what we were doing before. They listen to customer requests and develop new features incredibly fast. Plai is easy to use even for less techy people.

One of the best apps and white label services!Plai is an awesome platform - Logan and his team are amazing! This app replaces all of the overpriced (and underwhelming) white label marketing agencies on the market. We love it!

We've launched our first two Spotify ads, and the engagement, clicks, and listen- through rates have been really amazing - and cost-effective. This is a spectacular addition.

I waited to post this to see if support was great on the backend. I'm blown away! Support is incredible and product is hands down an undiscovered diamond.Been in digital marketing real estate niche for 12 years. Every realtor says the same thing after I taught a class. Love what you said but can you make it easier.Logan and the team have done an incredible job in the white label version. I have tried HEX, High Level and multiple platforms. The problem I always run into is onboarding and simplicity. Been looking for this for four years! Hands down product of the year! Congratulations guys great job!

 Generates new creatives designed to outperform the originals. Removes underperforming audiences, placements, keywords, and locations. Focuses your budget on what’s driving results — whether that’s leads, sales, or traffic. 
 At the campaign level, Plai uses Optimization Folders to shift your ad spend toward the top-performing campaigns — within or across platforms like Meta, Google, and TikTok. It automatically pauses low-performing campaigns and prioritizes the ones aligned with your goals, so you can drive more results without manually moving budgets.

Can I create social media posts with Plai too?
