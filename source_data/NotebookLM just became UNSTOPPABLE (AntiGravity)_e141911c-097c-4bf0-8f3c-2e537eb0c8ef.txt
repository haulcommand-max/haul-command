TITLE: NotebookLM just became UNSTOPPABLE (AntiGravity)
ID: e141911c-097c-4bf0-8f3c-2e537eb0c8ef

notebookm is one of the most powerful tools ever created However it's now possible to connect it to Google's anti-gravity unlocking insane capabilities Most people use Notebook LM as a chatbot and as such they get mediocre results But in this video I'm going to show you my new anti-gravity system that makes Notebook LM 10 times more powerful It gives you faster research better insights and even saves you money And I'm going to include stuff that I've not seen anybody else talk about And if you don't know who I am my name is Jack Roberts I built and sold my last tech startup with over 60,000 customers And now I run a sevenfigure AI automation business So if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in So Notebook LM is the world's number one for knowledge and learning and various other things It's incredible platform And Google's anti-gravity is Google's new app and it builds software It builds beautifully white dashboards gorgeous websites AI apps essentially anything you can imagine Um in this relationship for this video which has just very recently been made possible I want you to think of notebook LM as the brain and anti-gravity as the body which means you go from just knowing and learning to actually building and creating and lots more that I'm going to get into in this video Now anti-gravity and their book Alan are powerful but what happens when you combine them together using anti-gravity systems well turns out a significant amount Now most people use notebook LM like this They click on add new notebook They're in the files They're pushing buttons They're thinking about what they want to do manually It's very manual They have to think and prompt and it's slow to create at scale because essentially you're the bottleneck But imagine if you had a 500 IQ system Some say it might be 505 495 whatever And you plug that into Notebook LM Now I've spent hours on use cases specifically on this integration just to save bit of time to bring you the tilt of all the epic stuff it can do And I've baked it down to a really simple formula that you can follow in this video So this is what you can unlock You can create unlimited audio overviews video overviews infographics slide decks reports mind maps flashcards and even quizzes using anti-gravity programmatically with Notebook LM and even data tables You also get access to 32 different tools within Google's anti-gravity to connect to notebook LM and you can build which I find the most exciting use case is what I call super research agents So say for example you have an idea or you've had a meeting with a client or you've had an email from somebody or even maybe you've got a new customer or that customer's filled out a form on the website or something like that Whatever the trigger is you can now create multi-detailed books on any trigger about anything with a literally almost like over 40 different resources from different parts of web deep research on any given topic and multiple topics at that And we're going to do this with enhanced search as well So not only we're going to get essentially add infin item like so many different research topics we're going to be using the best models on the planet to make the queries significantly better and the better the query the better result And also you'll be able to download all of these resources that live with the notebook onto your very own laptop which essentially means that you now own all of the intelligence And with that intelligence you can build anything that you want to apps dashboards you literally name it And in addition to that you can also get a list of every single notebook you've ever created So if you're thinking dude do I have a notebook on I don't know getting a cool Casio watch or something well it can tell you and index that so you can actually find them easily You can also save so much money in anti-gravity using this You are effectively only limited to your imagination Now this sounds super interesting but it sounds like I'm speaking Spanish because you've never used anti-gravity before Go ahead and watch this video right here That will explain the 80/20 in like 10 minutes I'll wait here for you with my cup of coffee In a second you're back We can carry on But even if not what we can do is go for ABC's so you should still be able to follow along So the first thing we need to do is connect Notebook LM and anti-gravity together And I built a foolproof plan to help you do exactly that and then I can show you the capabilities what this can actually do Now the very first thing you need to do is download anti-gravity which you can do here I'll put all the links down below And then what we're going to do is come up here and grab this notebook setup guide I am going to put a link for you down below for everything all the resources in this video so you can kick butt and use them And effectively what we're going to do is we are going to copy this prompt right here I've detailed everything in terms of where we're getting the what we call the MCP configuration Man that sounds really technical MCP just means moral context protocol It's just how we're able to get anti-gravity to talk to notebook alarm And we can use the same technology It's like a universal remote control to talk to any app like notion or databases or just you can literally imagine What I've also included for you here as well is a list of all the combinations everything you can do based on your ideas language learning systems if you're doing a business and agency weekly competitive intelligence reports sell sales call prep systems proposal generators content creation that does slide decks for you literally podcast prep you literally name it all these resources will be down below So you can just click on it and check it out all the wonderful thing I mean it literally goes on and on It is a really really good room So now we've done that let's go over to anti-gravity And within anti-gravity you can see I've got an existing project Now I want to take a step back If you're looking to think Jack this looks a lot like code What the hell is going on you'd be what is known as completely normal But I promise you if you're going to stick with me for a couple of minutes this will make perfect sense for you The way that anti-gravity works and these other what we call IDE which is fancy term for integrated development environments is on the left hand side we typically have files And you see this on the right here is where we're going to be talking to Notebook LM And under the hood here you have all these awesome beautiful powerful models that can do things for us So we just speak in English and they do loads of cool stuff for us basically And as you can see this is just some of the stuff that I pulled from Notebook LM And it's all on my laptop Now I have all the files but what we're going to do is start completely from fresh So let's come over to file and then click on let's open up a folder I'm going to come down and click on new folder and call it notebook LM 2026 Cool So we open this one up and then we click on open down there And we are rocking and rolling Cool So the way that you are going to leverage number so assuming that you have an account signed in what we're going to do is come here to these three little dots and you click on MCP servers Now if you want to add any MCP servers in anti-gravity to connect it to other things other Google things you can just select them here add the manual I've got so many cool videos on my channel and the community showing you that But what we're going to do for the purpose of this video is click on manage MCP servers And here you're going to see a breakdown of all of the different servers So if something is red it just means that hey the connection's broken I can't hear it And the reason why this is rad is because I recycled my key my API key But the one that we're really interested in here is notebook Aln So as you can see these are all the things that you can do with an anti-gravity Look at it It's crazy This is This is just like a brand new thing But what I'm going to do is actually remove this and I'm going to set it with you perfectly step by step And believe it or not I can do that by just chatting to it And I think this is a great use case just to show you how this works So if you click on view raw config which is just the code behind it you can see that it's just a bunch of code So what I'm going to do is come back over here to the agent I'm going to say "Hey dude I would love you to remove my notebook lm MCP." That's literally it And all I'm going to do is do an at sign And the thing is you can call chapter files So this is mcp_conig So mcp_config Select it And then we got cla 4.5 Some say the best coding in the world which is awesome And what it will do is go ahead and remove that for us Cool So whilst that's doing in the background we're going to click on allow which is fine And we're going to see all disappear and we can set up together So let's head over now to the document and grab the instructions And then on this page all we're going to do is come down and grab this Now this is what we call an unofficial MCPO which means that it's not been done There's this expression I had in my last tech startup which is like you've either got to automate with them or automate through them So someone basically teams like built a way to connect them both And the way we connect it is in your browser So what this is going to do and I'm refreshing this by the way so you're going to see notebook LM disappear Now the way this works is it opens up a browser and you're signing into that browser on your laptop and then because of that it's then using that so you can control it what we call programmatically through anti-gravity Now it's gone That's awesome All you're going to do is come down and enter in this information here and hit enter Now what I did with this I also listed from the last video that I did a little bit of I'd say troubleshooting preemptively So like if there's any issues like what I think were the most common reasons it didn't like people struggled will be completely covered in make it easy So what it's going to do is open up a Chrome browser for us cuz that's one of our browsers And then we're going to sign in to Notebook LM And once we've done that we're goingble to test and I can start showing you some of the really cool stuff that you can do I understand that you understand the basics of Notebook LM But even if you don't you're going to learn so much from this video about what it can do And just like that it's actually opened up a Google browser for me And it's opening up my notebook LM which is cool But I need to actually be signed out I believe And we come down but the authentication process has started So sometimes if you ever find that it isn't working it might be that you need to just sign out of notebook and then let it sign you back in So just sign out open the browser and it works So this is not saying that it seems to work So it's got the cookies which is awesome And this is how we do it This is why a lot of LinkedIn scrapers for example how you scrape from LinkedIn they do it with cookies which is really cool So we can test if this works by clicking on the dogs clicking on MCP servers coming over to manage MCP servers and then click on refresh And we can see exactly what that looks like I've also included a for you the code that you can just copy and paste into the MCP server yourself And what we'll see appear magically soon is going to be the notebook lm And we're going to see all the different files And whilst that's just loading up for us let's actually now test and ask a question So hey there dude I would like you to go ahead and I want you to grab for me my last 10 notebooks and create me a file on the left hand side called Jack's notebooks And I'd like to have a link to each of those that I can go and click and check at my convenience Awesome Send that one off And if you're wondering by the way how I'm like yapping at it I'm using a speech of text called Glider that me and a couple friends actually founded Some say it's the fastest in the world I'll let you decide But anyway it's really cool and I find it just really helps to crush and make things a lot quicker If you cuz I I get like 100 questions on this every time Now if you check this out it's coming down show details It's now going to get the last 10 results It's I can tell I've got 64 notebooks which is really cool And then what we're looking for it to do is to correct those files for us on the left hand side which is really really freaking cool and just shows you because remember once you connect notebook LM to anti-gravity you can effectively do anything you want to now if you ever get this agent terminated due to error completely normal just click retry on it this software itself by Google since it's alpha so occasionally it happens and I can show you many workarounds and things with this but it'll just go straight back to it and start working for us and just like that it looks like it's completed it my last 10 notebooks in notebook LM here they all are untitled notebook Tony Robbins and yacht fulfillment is that true well let's click on it and have a look this was the last one actually cuz somebody posted it in my community and they want a bit support and again a bit more detail Yeah Cool And so we've now got access to it on our laptop How crazy is that and if you're wondering why does this look different one cool feature on the left hand side if you come down to extensions think of this like your app store but like the nerdy version of it you can type things in Now what this is for me is the below plugin which is office viewer So if you come up the top and type in office viewer then when you just one click install on that then you'll have a little bit more of a kind of like normal way of looking at things The other one I highly recommend that you install is Claude I'll come on to why a little bit later on I'll show you some of the functionality So claude code for VS Code Just install that one there And you can look at all this cool stuff and download it It's very very cool And then we just come back up here to click on files to get back to everything you can do now is also ask a question of any of these notebooks So for example let's just say I've got one here with a lot of sources Maybe we're looking at this one here Synergizing notebook LM and anti-gravity for air automations one But let's say I want to grab something from this Tony Robbins one right i might say something like "Hey dude could you just check my notebook and just answer the question what did Tony Roberts what was top three points?" And then I'd also like you to go ahead and create for me an infographic on that entire podcast please So there's no better way of demonstrating his capabilities than this And then we're going to go ahead and build an incredible system using this stuff that takes it honestly from just a knowledge something that's like knowledgeable to something that's an actual like system that's going to like make your life way more productive And you can see now it's done two different MCP tool calls First one here is finding the notebook which is cool and it's found the correct one and it will do this for you automatically by the way It knows what it's searching for which is really cool So it will figure out which of the notebook or milk books are going to be most relevant for you And then if we come and take a look at what it said here So look top three points from Tony Robbins interview is the shift from push to pull motivation moving from duty and suffering based success to joy and contribution driven fulfillment Two personas analytical Alex and anabolic Alex isn't about homozy and then that's cool And now what it's going to do is actually requested the creation of an infographic which we can actually go straight over now and validate has happened And just like that guys it's also going to head now and say it's completed the infographic for us So there's the fulfillment formula guide which is crazy So it says it's available Let's go and check it out And let's just open the link and see what we're dealing with And it's asking download it Sweet And when we download it we can see we've now got this image here for us to have a play around with And this is a fulfillment guide for achievers High achievers trap And just like that you've basically created this from just a prompt And you saw how crazy quick that was And just look at the beauty Look how easy all these like just look at the quality of this stuff guys And that's just from yapping at it And this believe it or not is just the beginning of what you can do with notebook alarm and anti-gravity And so now you've installed it connected it and you got the basics running And you know just typically how this thing actually works The next thing I want to do is for you to create what I call your brain We call this your basically your brain It's about you everything you're focusing on And the reason we want to do this is because we want to give anti-gravity and these incredible models full context about you which means that when we ask it questions it will give us way better results So I'm going to come ahead and grab this one from our community I'll also include this down below for you in one link so you can use everything So business brain is very cool Essentially what we're doing with this is we are getting information about your business or basically you if you're going to be productive And the way that this functions is a single source of truth So it covers what your business is what it does how you make money what your focuses are your target customer their gender age range location their top three pain points your customer journey any metrics where you're at right now your current business and your clicks profit closes I've spent a lot of time pulling this together so you don't have to really think too much about it You can just fill it out and have a good time We can include things about your team here if you want to current state And then part two is going to be about you as an individual So if you're not running a business you can just use part two but obviously we we talk a lot to business owners And then you got the maker which is what's your origin story what you're about what your goals and just enter all the information that you think is relevant And all you're going to do is just control A andrl C And genuinely I'd highly recommend that you grab the biggest coffee you can sit down with a big white white sheet of paper and just lean into this and really take the time to fill it out cuz once you filled it out once it's going to be an asset that's going to serve you for a long time And you can always just make you know edits So really do take a moment to fill this out and um I promise you you'll really enjoy it So I've got all this stuff What I'm going to do for the purpose of this video is just create some fictitious information So I'll do that very quickly So we have someone called Maya Chan former Mackenzie consultant helps professionals rebuild their energy and she did this after her own airport collapse became her wake up call she needed All right but now we've got that and we've got a graphic Let's head over to anti-gravity So what I want you to do in anti-gravity is come over on the left hand side and you're going to left click sorry right click excuse me click on new file and call this one brain.md like so Click on it and then just copy and paste all your stuff inside like so And then there we We've got everything ready to rock and roll Wonderful So now we've got your brain.mmd I found the best way to learn the capabilities is to build a system together So you and I are going to build a customer intelligence system with anti-gravity and notebook We're going to have a meeting After that meeting we're going to get the transcript automatically within anti-gravity and then we're going to create dynamically research based on the top threads of that meeting And then we're going to have that displayed in a beautiful dashboard That sounds complicated It's actually going to make it so easy We're going to use my five-step blast framework which helps you build literally any application you can imagine with an anti-gravity and wonderful So here we have our anti-gravity master prompt and again it's a blast framework just explain what it does just to give you some context then So the identity is a system pilot Your mission is to build deterministic self-healing automations in anti-gravity using the blast framework the blueprint link architect stylize and trigger framework It's a protocol It's got a three-layer architecture And the first one is what we call protocol zero So initialization and it's mandatory for your purpos C and then just throw it over to anti-gravity And then within anti-gravity what I recommend that you do always is just open a new tab And we do this just for context right so if models get less smart the longer you talk to them and just hit enter like that and just go bam and it's done And what it will do is create all the project files for us on the left hand side And crucially one of the interesting things about Protocol Zebra that we're asking to do is to create a task plan which means that whatever project that you want to build with notebook 11 anti-gravity you can see step by step by step everything that it's doing and make comments on them It's going to have a findings.mmd for any research it does it's going to have a progress update and I'm going to have a gemini.md Now gemini.md basically just means its brain that it's checking So you can put in thing things in there like its standard operating procedures how you want it to behave and everything So for example we will reference our brain.mmd or we might just put the brain.md in that file But there's many different ways to do it And then what we'll do we have a very systematic way to go through everything once it's finalized It's a blast setup So as you can see it's done the blast framework It's got all the files created It's got the whole execution It's all this awesome stuff So I want to explain what the north star is So let's set it right now I would like a dashboard And this dashboard is a customer intelligence research dashboard On the left hand side I'd like different tabs that go all the way down per meeting So there'll be a transcript in Notebook LM that I will provide And then essentially what you're going to do is take that transcript and I want you um once it's there to conduct research in Notebook LM based on let's just say the top five areas of inquiry that would be most valuable for me to know more information about So for example if it's a company that's selling let's just say design services let's look and I want to sell my services to them as an AI agency Maybe I want to understand the market capitalization the top competitors just stuff that you think is going to be relevant And then I'd like you to display that information in a really interactive and beautiful way I would also like to have a chatbot within that window where I can ask questions about that particular notebook and also ask you to do further research if I want to I want the design to look gorgeous and incredible and each tab on the left hand side represents a different meeting and it's all synced up Awesome So you basically explain it like that and send it straight off And a little side hack for you by the way if you really want something that's designed even better just swing over to aistudio.google.com It's a free software to use It's like the online version of anti-gravity The reason why this will give you a better visual output is because the online version is only focused about making something flashy and beautiful whereas anti-gravity builds software to scale So you don't have to do this You can still make it look amazing in anti-gravity It's just if you want a little sidebar hack to make it look even better And I'll show you what we do afterwards As you can see now it's complete It's come back with a checkpoint and it's asking us to basically approve the blueprint that it's given us And so now we're happy with the blueprint and it reflects exactly what we asked it to do The next thing we're to do in our five-step blast framework stands for L and that is linkage In other words making sure the anti-gravity has access to everything that it needs Now in our case it has access to notebook LM cuz we validated that As you can see in MCP servers we come over here and come back to manage MCP servers and we have notebook LM You can also connect Fireflies which is the AI meeting notetaker assistant but I'll touch on that later in this video because I want to really focus in on notebookm to keep it really focused for you But you basically make sure it's got all the connections So if you had a database or you calling notion or superbase it has everything that it physically needs to do the project And once you've done that and confirmed it you basically come back and say "Hey dude that sounds awesome Consider phase two ticked off Please proceed now to phase three and actually build it." And phase three is all about the architecture So what it'll do is write the technical SOPs written in a markdown It'll define its goal inputs tool logic and edge cases And the golden rule is if the logic ever changes it will update the SOP before updating the code And then obviously we've got the navigation which is decision-m the resync layer and we've got a series of tools it can go ahead and use to actually build us the product to make sure it's actually working for us in practice Now to test out the transcription we want to create like a transcript from a fake call Let's head back over to call and we can plug in fireflies afterwards I just want to keep it really simple to get something functional for you But I come back up here and I say "Hey dude could you create me a fake transcript between me this individual Maya Chan and a client who wants to purchase my services just make it no greater than let's just say a thousand words." Awesome And we can use this as an example for our dashboard Wonderful So now that's actually completed And remember the thing the thing that we're looking for here is what I call the minimal viable like functioning app that actually works cuz if we come back over now to the application which I think is over here and I'm pretty impressed with this to be honest with you I think this is really really sick really decent Not a bad crack Again if you want to increase the like how it actually works what I recommend that you do is head over to AI Studio build it in here and then what you can do once it's in here is come down and then you can actually if I exit this like I did here for example I come down I download the app like so and to your desktop right and you can open up the file You can then grab this file and drop it in the project and say "Hey I want you to replicate this design." Just a little hack if you want to take your design to a slightly new level after you've done that And so this is really cool But when I come down to create meeting for example it does this like almost like running through great we're creating a file for you We're doing notebook on notebook but we've not given it anything yet So this is a bug that we need to fix And this is what the a the architecture steps all about is just going back and forth with anti-graph saying hey this hasn't worked It's like the wrong thing Like it's crazy Let's figure it out And obviously you can make any designs for this But the point is you want to have this back and forth with anti-gravity So for example when you come back and you can say hey dude go fix it It'll then start doing his changes and he can test it again And as you can see guys based on a transcript that anti-gravity has now created this and I can come ahead and refresh it and show what that looks like and we can check in how it's all getting on So you can see behind the hood all the things that happening I'm going to come off this one here and it's actually going to head now and researching websites based on the input from anti-gravity And you can see that it's actually controlling it in real time And then once anti-gravity has created something that you think is cool and works to the exact specifications you are going to need to go back and forth with it a little bit based on the specifics Typically speaking the better the first prompts the way better the outcome is But we can see now if you actually come in and check on let's go over to the browser and have a look We have this beautiful dashboard and actually in the book LM we have a bazillion of sources that it's pulled specifically 127 sources from our transcript alone You can open in book lm whereas in the local host you can see all the specifics that it has done that So if I just full screen this for example you've got export PDF option and this is basically just a representation of everything You could build this in any way that you wanted to You could add an AI in here to chat with all of the research You could add anything I mean it's got so much stuff you can do but you can see the competitive landscape strategic AI fit Then there's a bazillion different things that we could do here High ticket coaching funnels community platform comparisons I mean it's done lots of stuff And the cool thing here is that if this doesn't look the way that you want it to look and again here's the transcript for me when I look at it You can build whatever And again this is just an example You could build literally anything you could potentially imagine Now the key thing is the transcript right how do we get that well actually you come down here to if I just open up the browser So you do command and L and then you come over to these three dots You click on MCP servers and you can find a manage MCP servers You can basically add Fireflies to the integration I've showed it quite a few times but what I'll do I'll put the link for the basically Fireflies MCP config down below And all you would do is create an AI meeting note ticket So that could be Fireflies that could be another good one is Fathom I'm not affiliated with these guys in any way but effectively any meeting you have appears here You come down to settings developer settings and you'll have an API key and all you're going to do is copy that API key You're going to come back over here and then you're going to basically say to it something on the lines of let me come to the chat agent real quick We're right here back to agent I'm going to say "Hey there I would like you to add the Fireflies MCP to my MCP config." The below is my Fireflies API key All right You're going to come down and you're going to click on view raw config And as you can see it's mcp_config right so you come down and you say it's at mcp_config.json And then I give my API key equals And then you drop it in So let me grab mine real quick And as you can see guys it's done and completed it for me I basically just gave it the prompt Now if I come back and click refresh this should go from a not very nice red to a wonderful green Then what I can say is "Hey dude could you just confirm to me what was the title of my last meeting and who were the participants and what was the first sentence that was said?" You can use the Fireflies MCP to grab that information And you can see Firefly is now fully enabled I can ask it a question You can see it's now using the Fireflies MCP And the idea is that you can build up this like Alexandria's library of connectors and softwares and platforms to make anti-gravity something really spectacular It's a real gamechanging software And I cover a lot of like what the technology that works the most Like that's my thing is like what's the thing that actually drives it and it's it's such an exciting time to learn this sort of stuff We've got a community meet up in London happening next month and then Japan and South Africa tomorrow where I'm actually flying to in the morning So you're probably going to see this slightly after that So this is fair Let's quick retry So here we go We brought it down These email addresses will probably be censored cuz I want to dox my uh my buddies But you get the idea Now it's pulled it down and it's pulled down the very first sentence which was 24 hours or something like that Some say it's poetry I'm not saying that but I've heard others say that And then once we've crossed step three the next phase is stylization So this is the bit where we basically just make it look as incredible and as gorgeous as possible Then phase five is trigger where we basically deploy it and we say well how would we like this to work how often do I want you to pull down meetings or how often do I want you to do my personal knowledge base you can really have fun with this And then I've also included down here's operating principles for the agent So before it answers anything it will do all this stuff and kneeling repair loop deliverables and intermediatories And of course it's got all this file structure too Now you know how to connect anti-gravity to notebook LM If you don't understand how to build AI systems and make gorgeous designs like that stylization level you're never going to get the full experience of this technology And we can learn that by watching this video right
