ID: 4cec83bd-9b73-4d7d-8f47-f1fc60cd700a

what if you could send blue bubble text messages from your highle sub accounts or even from another CRM That's what we're talking about in today's video Because for over a decade Apple has trained its users to look at these blue bubbles as hey this is a real human texting me And subconsciously they kind of feel like oh if it's a green bubble it's probably automated And so there's a real ROI in being able to actually automate those blue texts building the trust and the credibility and the response rate from the people that you're messaging in your sales process And let me tell you some of the companies selling this know exactly how valuable it is It can cost over $10,000 per year just to plug one number in with one of the providers that I'm going to go over in this video And trust me there's much cheaper options We're going to go over the most affordable options to the most expensive and everything in between in this video But before we do I want to go over some data that shows whether or not you should actually be thinking about doing this and if you should offer it to your clients First of all 58% of US smartphones are iPhones which means that over half of your leads can get blue text messages Secondly according to one study SMS reply rates green bubbles are 1 to 3% Whereas iMessage reply rates are 8 to 15% In addition to that you don't have to do A2P registration You don't technically have to add optout language and you don't have to pay per message or pay carrier fees On top of that you can send native iMessage voice notes to your prospects And some of the options that I'm going to show you today even allow you to have a contact card So let me ask you if you got this text or this text which one are you responding to And if you're wondering hey I know over half the people are on iMessage but what about the people that aren't The smart move is iMessage when available and fall back to SMS when it's not an iPhone And every single option we're going over today has that feature By the way this video is all independently researched It takes a ton of time to make sure we're giving you accurate information I really appreciate it if you leave a like on the video and if you end up signing up for any of these services If you use my link below I get a small kickback and it helps support the channel so we can get more stuff out to you like this So let's get into it When it comes to sending iMes you have two options You can go with a company that hosts the hardware and the software themselves and you just get it plugged in or you can host the hardware yourself meaning that you have an existing iPhone or you buy another iPhone and you use that to send the text messages And of the five companies we're reviewing today four fit into that first category where they connect everything for you and they own the hardware and the software So we've got SendBlue Link Project Blue and Blue Yo And these companies all basically work the exact same way They own hundreds or thousands of iPhones that they rent out to their users And they take the iPhone that they assign to you and they get that line connected inside of your Highle account as a custom conversation provider Then you can start texting and using them in your existing automations or new automations that you built Unless you run into customer service issues it's going to be a pretty seamless setup across the board Every one of these companies has had people with good experiences and bad experiences I haven't personally used every single one of them although we did hop on calls to verify pricing info We didn't get onboarded so I can't say "Oh this one was better than the other one." But again they all have positive and negative reviews You're probably going to have a similar experience Now when it comes to differences Senblue is actually backed by Y Combinator which is the most trusted startup incubator in the world They have some funding from that and they have a really good network So if that really matters to you then they might be a good option Link is also venturebacked although I could not find out by who and their main differentiator is that they have a mobile first CRM that they built and then they built link blue their iMessage product So when you buy the iMessage product you actually get the CRM with it You can actually manage everything from your phone and have a CRM included So if you're just signing up directly and you want to have an iMessage first CRM this could be a really cool option for you When it comes to Blueio one of their most unique things is they have this shared number feature where for $200 less than their other plan you can share an iPhone number with somebody else But you could not convince me any day of the week to share a phone number with somebody else even if I was doing incredibly low volume So to me signing up for this shared number feature is not even comparable to these other companies because none of them have this shared number And when it comes to Project Blue one of their main differentiators is they have an agency plan that allows you to become a reseller I'll go over exact pricing later but what it does is it allows you to avoid any setup fees and roll it out for a lot cheaper to all of your clients Now let's see the other side of the coin With my CRM SIM you do have to host your own hardware and that's going to include an iPhone and a Mac computer but they can literally be a $150 iPhone and a $200 Mac Mini You can get nicer ones than that Maybe you have an old phone or computer lying around that you could use But literally for 350 bucks you can have what you need to run two lines because each iPhone can have a dual SIM and you can run up to four numbers from a Mac The other thing is that the iPhone does have to have a cell phone plan For example this is my iPhone that I use to run iMessage through one of my high level sub accounts through my SR SIM and it cost me about $15 a month for unlimited text and unlimited messaging which is pretty cool They are working on a solution that's currently in beta to get rid of the need to buy a Mac So depending on when you're watching this you may not need to do that at all On top of those requirements you will have to do the setup yourself with my CRM SIM but it's not too bad It took me about 30 minutes once I had my iPhone set up and there's a ton of helpful videos plus their support is pretty good So that's pretty much it as far as the differences between all five of these One thing to be aware of that all of these have in common is that you should not send to more than 50 unique contacts per day from one line So if you're trying to do like a mass reactivation of 5,000 phone numbers you're going to have to do those quite slowly Now you can have unlimited interactions back and forth with those 50 unique contacts per day but you should not be reaching out to them and you should not be blasting a ton of texts at the same time or you're likely to get flagged and shut down by Apple So now let's get into the question on everybody's mind How much does this cost Who's the most affordable etc Now to keep this super simple I'm going to do this in two ways We're going to have one section where I share the cost to get one line with one of these providers for one year total because we're not just doing it for one month Let's see what the cost is for the entire year And then we'll talk about if you're doing a bit more volume and you have four lines what that would look like So first of all if you get one line the most expensive option is going to be SendBlue It is $1,000 a month for one line in one highle sub account or whatever CRM you're connecting with for a total of $12,000 a year Next up we have Blueio which for a dedicated number is going to cost you $289 a month plus a $50 setup fee for a total of $3,518 for the year Following them we have Project Blue who charges $500 setup and then $300 a month per line So if you average that out over the year it's $341 a month for a total of $4,100 for the year It is worth noting that if you pay for the year upfront with Project Blue it does bring the price down significantly to just about $2,000 waving the setup fee and bringing the monthly cost down Fourth we have Link who also charges a $500 setup fee and a $200 a month maintenance fee for a total of $242 per month or $2,900 for one year And finally My CRM SIM Assuming you buy a $250 Mac Mini a $150 iPhone SE you get a $15 a month carrier plan and you pay for my CRM SIMs $29 per line fee for iMessage you're going to come out at a total of $71 a month on average or $928 for the whole year which is over three times more affordable than the closest competitor which is Project Blue if you pay upfront Now things do start to get a little bit different when you add more lines And this is really the big question around this is are you just using it yourself or are you also going to offer it to your clients So let's go over those With SendBlue if you add an extra line to an existing sub account that you already have set up with them it's just 200 a month So a th000 a month for the first one and then 200 a month for the additional ones that you add inside of that sub account So if you have multiple reps inside of a single sub account let's say you buy four lines you'd be paying 1,600 a month or 21,600 a year Now if you add those two separate sub accounts then you're going to end up paying the $1,000 per additional sub account So if you have four lines on four different sub accounts you're talking nearly $50,000 a year for those four lines Next up we have Blueio which has tiered pricing depending on how many lines you have And if we do four lines it comes out to $272 a month each for a total of $13,56 for the year Next up we've got Project Blue After that first 300 a month line each additional one is just 200 a month So you come out to about 1,67 a month for four lines or 12,800 for the year unless you pay annually then you'd be at 7,992 Additionally Project Blue has their agency plan that I mentioned earlier And the way this works is you pay $1,000 upfront for two lines that you get to use for your own agency And then for each additional line it's 150 a month with no setup fees So you could charge let's say a $500 setup fee to your client to set up the iMessage for them Then you could charge $200 to $300 a month for the line in their account and then pay Project Blue the 150 a month And if you did this with four lines it would come out to 15,600 a year $12,000 to be the agency reseller and 3600 for the two client lines in this case Obviously this makes more and more sense the more people you roll it out to With Link you're going to be at about $967 a month if you average out the setup fees or $11,600 a year And then lastly we have my CRM SIM For four lines you just need two iPhones cuz each iPhone can have two lines on them Then you'll need a carrier plan for each one of those lines So that's 15* 4 per month so $60 per month And then the My CRM SIM fee of $29 per line By the way that goes down to $19 per line if you have over 10 lines But the total you're looking at advertised over the year is $222 a month or $2,662 which now when you get up into volume is four times more affordable than the next option Now it is important to note that if you were to come to one of these companies and say "Hey I want to do 50 lines or 100 lines," you would likely get a volume discount A lot of them have a little enterprise thing where you can click and get enterprise pricing on the demo So for volume yes it may go down but I doubt they're giving out amazing discounts at just four lines So if you're in the camp where you want to use this in your own highle sub account and you want to give it out to some clients who maybe don't qualify for A2P or just want iMessage because it's going to get better results then I think your decision here is pretty clear If you don't want to mess around with the hardware yourself this is how I think everything stacks up If you don't mind shared numbers and you're super low volume Blueio is the obvious choice at $39 or $89 a month However if you want dedicated I think the clear second choice as long as you can pay upfront for the year is Project Blue at 166.50 a month After that I would choose Link especially if you're interested in their mobile first CRM for 200 month plus the $500 setup fee And then next of course would be the dedicated Blue Yo plan followed by SendBlue who is by far and away the most expensive But as we saw you can get it for three or four times cheaper with my CRM SIM if you're okay hosting the hardware yourself And that's it If you don't know what High Level is and you want to find out more check out the video somewhere up here And we'll see you next step
