TITLE: How I Build $100,000 CEO Systems in 25 mins (AntiGravity)
ID: eb5a476a-5e16-4fcc-9728-ceffd9d9b194

ever wish your AI could help you run your business instead of just answering questions google's anti-gravity has just changed everything about running a business in 2026 now most people just use AI as a tool but in this video I'm going to show you how you can combine anti-gravity with tools like notion to give it unlimited context so it can remember everything actually do work for you collaborate with your team make you more money and save you hours of time in the process and if you don't know me my name is Jack Roberts i built and sold my last tech startup and now I run a sevenfigure AI automation business so if you haven't already grab that coffee and let's dive straight in so let's go into the systems that run my 7igure business and the ones I've helped many others set up now here's the thing the top 0.1% have now a very unfair advantage and when it comes to anti-gravity there are two different levels that you can approach it with we have the first thing which is systems that's stuff like dashboards and websites and automations that run for us and then we have what we call sessions which is very different now systems do defined stuff for our business right dashboards and automations they run in the background they're very structured and they're very automated and the second thing we can do though with anti-gravity and things like claw code are sessions now sessions where you will basically sit down with this AI you talk to it and it could go in whatever direction that you want to right and only very recently has it become possible to actually use this technology to get ahead now what we call this is creating a co-pilot with AI for your business or your projects or anything interesting that you're doing it's like having a 500 IQ Jarvis sat with you in the cockpit that also remembers everything and has unlimited context about your business your numbers your financials your plans your team everything and it makes creating great decisions very easy and these can be on any topic that you want to at any time without repeating context whether you want to grow your business or you just want to be 100 times more organized in your life these systems going to help you crush it you're going to go from this to this you're going to be very happy at the end of it so when we think of sessions we need only two things we need to give it a beautiful memory and then we need a place to actually share that memory and engage with them and so we can think of this as the co-pilot for your life the co-pilot for your business these CEO systems and we're going to build them across a very clearly defined four-step maps framework now let's imagine first of all that you and I are going to get some work done to our garden we want a landscaper but we don't tell the landscaper who we are where we live or even what garden we want to the chances are the quality of the garden that we get if we get it at all is going to be really bad and just in the exact same way when we're trying to use this incredible AI system with our business we have to give context and information our business DNA to these systems which is why the first M stands for mission so the first thing we're going to do is open up a brand new anti-gravity instance and you're going to fill out something called the business DNA blueprint so the idea with this is that we want to dictate everything about our business this is going to be the most important context for who you are so if you're somebody for example who is a YouTuber you're trying to grow on YouTube or you've got a business that's selling financial services this is the place this is going to be the core context through which all of the systems that we get in anti-gravity are going to help us out so we basically specify things like the business what it is who it serves how it runs target customer and the very first thing that I would do is grab a speechto text software glad is one that I founded a couple of my co-founders fastest in the world right now so you can actually come over you can literally come on here and describe your ideal customer hey my ideal customer is a large potato that likes eating French fries whatever the thing is right you can actually then just detail all of this stuff down and it makes the whole process five times quicker so you want to pretty much provide the core context the details that you must include in this is going to be what the business is all the things about your age the location we need new things about the problems that you solve as a business all of your core details so you can just follow a template just like this enter in all the information and then we're going to save this on the left hand side as your business DNA and this is going to live in the project folder so this is great for getting core context about the business now the next thing that I want you to do and this is a very quick little hack if you're not familiar with this is Google Gemini so when we're running our business one of the things we may want to do is chat with our calendar or chat with our email you can do this in Gemini now so for example if you don't know you can say something like "Hey dude I just got an email about an appointment what was the first name of the person that did that and could you just let me know what appointments I'll have later on today what's really interesting with this with Gemini now is that you can have conversations with your inbox and you can have conversations with your calendar so when you're thinking of AI co-pilot this is literally insane that you can do this now in the actual Gemini window with using the latest Gemini model so when it comes to chatting with things like your emails and calendar you want to be using this in the chat window and as you can see now I can get this kind of core information back from it about who I'm meeting with and what's happening up like my entire calendar schedule which makes running it extremely easy so once we've actually built and developed this so I'm going to put a link down below for this information so you can actually check this out and fill out for yourself now we have a couple different file types here first of all this is what we call static aren't really going to change that much we keep that in our project window the other thing that I want you to add here is going to be what we call the operating system MD and I'll put this down below for you as well an idea with this is this kind of just explains and articulates how we want anti-gravity to answer and respond to our core questions and what we want to reference as it's actually being referenced now knowing about our business is incredible but if our great landscape in our analogy doesn't have any tools if we've got Iron Man without the Iron Man outfit we're not actually able to make any meaningful progress in our actual business and so the next A stands for actions and this is where we can actually now use the power of anti-gravity to create and do anything for us in the running and creation of our business now what we're going to be using for this is notions so here's what I want you to imagine okay we have a notion database which is an incredible productivity tool some people like Obsidian i'll touch on that in a second and why I think notion is a 50,000 times better right now is the idea is that we want we can have spaces for anything so we can have SOPs to-do lists we could have competitor research we could have YouTube checklists and anti-gravity can live inside our notion database and do anything for us and what's also really cool is we can share this with our team we can share this with people that we work with that we collaborate with and we can get this full context now which is going to be insane so the question is how do we actually connect this to anti-gravity well great question so if we come over to anti-gravity I can show you how we connect you can even see here with this operating system the four pillar framework it's so so cool all right so we're going to use what's called an MCP model context protocol all it means is just a standard way that apps can talk to other apps without having to fuff around so we click on additional options going to come down to MCP servers and by the way if you're still brand new to you I'll put a link on screen for a full anti-gravity masterass that will take you from beginner to winner very quickly so what you're going to do is search for notion like so and we should see this appear for us magically this is already installed for me but what you'll need to do is go ahead and install it so I'm actually going to go ahead and refresh this one so let's come down here and configure it and what you'll see here is a notion API token so you're going to click on this link right here this is going to open up a new page for integrations and you're going to create a brand new integration for anti-gravity so click on new integration we'll call this one something like anti-gravity 5000 beautiful and then associated workspace be your own workspace you can even add a logo if you want to if you feel particularly fancy which I'll do right now loaded a profile photo and I can click on save okay now what this has done is created a brand new integration like so and I can click on configure integration settings and then what you're going to see on this guys is an internal integration secret so you can basically select everything you're happy for it to do and all you're going to do is show this code come back over to anti-gravity and you're going to put it in the notion API token and when you've done that what you can then be able to do is come over to manage MC servers on the right and you'll see a list of all the ones you've got access to so we've got N10 and we've got notion and it basically lets it do all these incredible actions in notion but we've got one other step to do before I can release the magic so I hope you're buckled in and sufficiently caffeinated for this so what I now want to do if I come back over to notion is let's say this is a space that I want to share it with okay what I can do here is you're going to come down right side to share excuse me to the three dots here and these are going to be essentially like every notion page functions almost as its own entity so you decide what you want to share and where so you're going to come down to connections and then you're going to click on the connection that you just created so one I created earlier was anti-gravity i just click on that i click on confirm now what that means is anti-gravity has full unfeted access to our notion database now and this is where it starts to get crazy now I've come back over here into our database and I've filled out the business DNA with some sample information so you can get a sense of it so let's come back over to the agent and ask it to build something in notion for us now which is very cool so check this out this just show you how powerful this is hey dude I'd like you to build for me a couple of different documents number one is I want you to make for me a to-do list build that into a table make it gorgeous make sure there's things like an owner a due date an action and add like eight actions on there something specific around growing your YouTube channel after that I'd like to create a teams page for me with four different roles for Ben Bob Bill and Bassandra and write down an overview of what their roles are what they do and what they're responsible for on top of that and then finally I'd like you to create for me an SOP document an SOP page with different SOPs that I can use my business for things like onboarding offboarding clients that kind of thing beautiful and then we're going to say hey use the notion MCP to build this and before we do this just ask if there's any other clarification questions that you have beautiful and then we've got Gemini 3 in the planning mode which is really cool and then we'll send that off so I'm doing this a bit of an overview so you can see but the core idea here is any project that you're doing now lives in Notion and we can use that so you can see it's come back with some clarification questions we would just answer so we' say "Hey yes I want the YouTube tracker team page and SOPs to be under as sub actions but pull SOPs into their own thing youtube actions yeah just do what you think is best yes those are the team ben can be the editor just assign some random roles for the time being then SOPs yes I'd like you to actually draft those in line with the information I've given you on the left hand side." Beautiful and now I've actually finished building those things out and we've got the links so we can see and open this up in Notion and bear in mind it's done this just off a prompt so once I open it up you can see I've got all of this stuff here so team actions bam bam bam and I can I basically share this with my team we can update actions i can ask anti-gravity where we at with different projects and resources we've got everything in here from the team so I can come down have a look at all the different roles that we've got i can come back to the co dashboard go over my to-do list and add in anything that I want to so for example what I could do now if I wanted to enrich the to-do list is I could come back over and we're going to say something specifically like "Hey dude on the to-do list I would like this to look more like a table please with different individuals and different actions and add say five different things on to-do list that would be helpful if I was trying to get a video out by Friday so now we can actually let loose the power of anti-gravity with full context to actually come and use it." And remember it has its context and it knows what to do because it's supposed to check its operating system document which explains that actually the first thing we need to do is go and check out all the context so everything's context rich i should also mention by the way that we can get all our meeting notes in notion itself so it becomes this living breathing database but one things we may want to do is get more context about our website and add that in there so we get even more information and if you're doing that for yourself clients we can use the fire crawl MCP which is very very cool and all we're going to do for that because it's not a native integration anti-gravity is you're going to come over to anti-gravity you're going to come down here to these dots come to MCP servers and you can see there's no fire crawl right so we want to enable our anti-gravity to actually go ahead and scrape and chat to websites cuz that's effectively what this lets us do we come to manage MCP servers and all I want to do is come down to basically view raw config and this has got all the information for all of our integrations what we're going to add into this pull from Claude here which basically is the code to add the file crawl MCP server and all you're going to do which says bearer is replace this your API key with this so you're going to copy this come back over and you're going to enter it into this section here and then add it into anti-gravity and if you don't know how to do that you can literally copy this and say "Hey add this into this MCP list for me." And all you do is you basically copy all of that and then actually AI will add that in for you automatically and when you've added that additional information in and we come over and we can just l click on save uh and then shut this mcp config down what we can then say if we click on refresh we should see fire crawl appear on the lefth hand side when that's all loaded up and it now means it can go ahead and search a website so one of the things I could do is say hey this is my website go ahead and complete it so this looks like it needs one additional step and once you add that in you can see you've got fire crawl here which is cool so it lets you scrape map do anything that you want to which is really really really cool and so now what I can say is hey my website is scalewithteddy.com can you use the firecrawl mcp to grab loads of information from that website and add it into the business section under website please so now this how has the tools and if you think about it like this guys what's really cool now is that it can at any point we want to go ahead and use and leverage these tools to scrape and talk and chat to websites so we've enabled it with verse now the other thing that we may want to do in talking to it cuz again we're doing things on notion which is very very cool very handy we've got things where we can scrape websites so as you can see now it's even updated the YouTube tracker page which is amazing and now it can go ahead and search and scrape websites so we're getting this beautiful full context for how we want to think about things right and maybe we want to think a bit about our team our team actions what everyone's doing what we're thinking about we can now actually have this and when I have conversations with it it can lean over grab that context and make things easier the other thing that we can do is connect this to NA10 MCP with a really simple flow that looks like this which we have a web hook trigger we basically enable this to be shared with MCP that's how it works at the NA10 level now the way I want you to think about NA10 is that if you can't connect your MCP if you cannot connect anti-gravity to think directly NA10 is like your catch all na10 is the connector it's that super social friend that knows everybody dude you need some freaking Bud Light dude I've got 15 creative Bud Light it will connect you so when you want to do things like with the Google API like sending emails or creating appointments and stuff like that stuff you can't do in Gemini we can then just create a scenario like this in NHM make it an MCP describe what it does exactly and then just connect that to anti-gravity which now gives anti-gravity the ability by virtue of the connection with NATM to do anything we want to so now we actually have the system that can create appointments create emails do anything we want to all with an anti-gravity whilst at the same time managing all of our files and all of our access and even I come back here you can see with the different things it's done here it's scraped scale with teddy.com using a fire crawl mcp it's done loads of great stuff it's got business DNA it's done everything it's got our social proof our revenue our stats all the clients that we've helped but come down to business DNA now you can see it's got everything there ready to rock and roll which is gorgeous really really love that and so now we've created this incredible CEO system that has full access to all the information we want to we can collaborate it can create anything for us it can create documents it knows everything about our business it can scrape websites it can do incredible things how do we actually give it a longterm memory well this very nicely leads onto one of the biggest problems that exists here which is context window that everyone runs into because the last thing you want is Gemini spending its expensive tokens or Claude 4.5 searching through thousands of words of documents it's a huge issue because if we had a contract six months ago and we're like well what's happening with this contract we can burn through so many tokens so this leads us very nicely then onto the third step in our fourstep framework which stands for past now to do this we're going to use something called long-term memory known as retrieval augmented generation so here's the thing think about your memory like this okay on the left hand side we have core information core context about the business that doesn't change this is the stuff that we expect to use all the time it doesn't move that much and it's really really really important then on notion we have our active working stuff so we'll have different projects we've got to-do lists we've got SOPs that we can reach over grab and edit and move around as we want to but we also want a place where Gemini can access all the files on our computer without really actually damaging any of its contact and for that we're going to use the Pine Cone MCP for its long-term memory so to do this we can click on additional options MCP servers and just type in pine cone and just like every other MCP that I've showed you you're going to connect it in the exact same way when you come into the configure section you can pine cone API key open it up and that will lead you to pine cone.io now if you're not familiar with what rag is or retrieval augmented generation I'll put a link on screen i did a big like most comprehensive master class ever on it about everything about rag and all that effectively lets us do is take large but large sways of documents and informations and instead of like reading every single let's say we had like seven Harry Potter books instead of reading all seven at the same time what this does is trunk them up into like a thousand different pieces and it only grabs the most relevant section for our query which basically means that we don't spend any of our precious context window and Gemini is going to stay on the task stronger for longer so what you will do is you're going to come down you're going to create an index so when we're creating a new index we'll call this one anti-gravity what I would like you to use is the E5 large there's basically like a leaderboard of all these incredible models this one is freaking sick so this is one of the most powerful ones field map is text that's absolutely fine leave all this as it is it's okay and then come down and click on create index beautiful and it's initializing and when it's done it's ready to rock and roll so this is a way bigger model we can store way more the embeddings which means how it stores the information is way better and the performance is pretty incredible now all the documents we load are going to go here they're going to be chunked and thrown in there so I'm going to get a random contract and we're going to actually add in this together now the cool thing about anti-gravity is we can have all the stuff in anti-gravity we say "Hey dude I want you to add this into our database." And what I would like you to do on the left hand side and I'll put this down below for you as well is what we call the pine cone registry so what we've done here is specify some things so we can actually specify metadata which means that when we go back to retrieve and look into pine cone we can actually find and look around and say well actually I'm looking for an SOP or I'm actually I'm looking for a contract and we've labeled everything in it so it's very easy to find so the categories I recommend contract proposal meeting research internals with with with specifics about what they are now what you can do here is actually feed this information to it so let me upload a sample contract and I'll show you exactly how this works so as you can see I've got this letter of terms between Teddy AI and the UFC which would be very very cool client and we've got loads of cool information here about fake contracts so all you're going to do with any of these documents is come over let's create a folder i'm going to call this folder something like long-term memory okay sweet and then anything I want to vectorize I'm just going to throw in my long-term memory thing let's go ahead and grab that contract and I've just dropped it into the long-term memory so what I'm going to say to it now is come over to our AI let's come up and full screen this let's come back over to anti-gravity have a little chat with him of course we could be doing this multi- aent views i'm just keeping this super simple for you i'm going to say something like "Hey there dude i would like you to store in long-term memory all the documents I've just added to long-term memory like the Teddy AI UFC contract make sure that you label it properly and that you can read it before putting it into the Plank database all these need to be put into the anti-gravity database." Thank you awesome and we send that one off and then what this will do you can also by the way upload PDFs and if it doesn't have the right kind of components to read the PDF it'll just download it for you so you don't have to really worry or stress so much about all the different extensions and manipulating it now because anti-gravity can take that weight off your shoulders so all you do is you put everything you want to make in a folder you throw it into your project folders and it will store all for you in Pine Cone and then this itself can reach over and grab and access it whenever we want to which is so freaking cool and just like that it's successfully updated it so let's head over to our database and see if it's there so if you click on anti-gravity we should see a contract and you can see UFC contract is there and obviously we can specify the embedding models and all this sort of stuff but if we ask any questions now so for example if we come back over and I actually delete this all the files here right the only way to prove that it works is I come down here move these to trash I might say something like hey just check our long-term memory we we had a contract with the UFC could you just tell me what the price was in that contract that okay so now we'll actually go ahead and use our long-term memory and instance this might be hey we had a meeting about 9 months ago about this particular thing i forgot what we said what were the specifics what were the particulars of that conversation and what it will do is actually go ahead and grab all of that information bring it back and then with that you can pretty much do anything that you like and just like this guys we've got all the information then it's been pulled 30% up front 30% then 114,000 and the other thing to bear in mind guys is anytime we upload a document it's uploaded here into user uploaded document so we've got you have CI in agreement something we with glido so essentially if we ever like say update a policy we update an SOP we update something and we upload it we can actually what we call upsert which is to update and or insert something into Panka so if that's no longer the latest thing you're not going to have an old contract and a new contract together it will just supersede and overrun the old one because we're applying a unique ID to it and it just makes this whole system so freaking fearsome now we know who we are what we're currently doing what we've done previously the next thing that we need to know is the numbers which is the fourth step of our process which stands for stats now the idea with stats here is that we want to give the living breathing financial information about the business the latest annually recurring revenue contract size expenses all this sort of stuff so we can actually speak to these databases intelligently and to do that of course we're going to use superbase so we're going to come over to the MCP service and click on install Superbase which is fine and then we give it a superbase access token so click on this here to open up in a new tab if you're not familiar with Superbase it's basically like Microsoft Excel it's been hitting the weights ready to kick some butt we can create a new token right here we'll call this one anti-gravity expires in however many days you're happy with click on generate token and then what we're going to do is we'll copy this token and then share it back over into anti-gravity and then once you've entered it in there when you click on refresh it will appear so we'll come back over to manage our MCP servers right here and then Superbase should appear for us on the left hand side in just a second and right there you can see Superbase is available and ready to rock and roll we typically don't want to go over 50 so you can kind of pick which ones you're using which ones you're not that's really just to protect the think of it as a context window for the model but it's really cool now it's got access to Super Base it can pretty much do anything we want to so I just want to show you an example of what that looks like what I would encourage you to do is encou it might be something like company financials right and you can put all of your data all of your screenshots all of your Excel documents all of that stuff here in that document and you can ask it then to like essentially create a beautiful designed dashboard for you with all the data in Superbase that you can access so for example if I come to the agent here and you can see guys after giving it information it's basically going to create this thing this whole new database schema everything so I don't have to configure or turn the dials in Superbase it's done that for me and if I actually come over to Superbase which would be over here we can check this out ourselves so let's come over and check it out and have a quick look at the data that we've got that's live now the idea with this is that you would connect this to your business metrics your business dashboards which we can build systems to do that very very easily so everything's all linked in linked in and synced up you come down the left hand side to database which is where all of the data bases live and have a good time and frolic in the fields of data as they say and you can see we've got tables and these are just all the tables we have in our business right so this is an example I use for my text to speech one uh our startup you got dictations logs daily metrics funnel metrics we've got all of this core information so so cool you can check it all out in the tables and this essentially is a living breathing the numbers behind things so when you're having conversations about what should I do we now have context about the data now what's very cool here is that with databases in superbase okay think about this is going to blow your mind really important to understand in pine cone okay we can ask questions about text right we can say look well what what was the fifth principle in my book that I really want to remember or how do I build amazing offers and then in here we can say what's the trend line for my business so we actually have this this agent now the system the co system that can reach over and understand the data and can also to reach over and understand the actual text and it can update it all dynamically in both cases which is unprecedented like what you used to have to do to get that is unbel this is a literal cheat code so let's recap this maps system we have mission who I am actions the stuff I'm doing the past which is everything I've done and then stats the numbers behind it all and now you've got all of this data coupled together the next step is then to put it into a beautiful and gorgeous dashboard So we can make executive level decisions very quickly
