# The Reliability Standard (Risk Intelligence Infrastructure)

This is not a "review site." This is a **Decision-Support System** designed to sell certainty and reduce operational risk in heavy haul logistics.

## 1. Submission Identity Layer (Anti-Chaos)
Anonymous data is excluded. Professionalism requires accountability.
- **Required Identity**: Full Name, Company Name, Role (Escort/Broker/Carrier), Phone/Email.
- **Verification Stack**: MC/DOT Lookup match, LinkedIn/Business presence, or Phone OTP.
- **Rule**: Delayed publication. All submissions are queued for a human scan to prevent "Spike Manipulation."

## 2. Professional Scoring Model (The Standard)

We use weighted operational metrics. Heavier weight is given to **Payment** and **Safety** as they represent existential risks.

| Metric | Weight | Question (Scaled 1-5) |
|---|---|---|
| **Payment Reliability** | **25%** | Paid within agreed terms? |
| **Safety Culture** | **20%** | Pressured unsafe timeline/decisions? |
| **Rate Integrity** | **15%** | Was the rate honored start-to-finish? |
| **Permit Accuracy** | **15%** | Dimensions and routing 100% accurate? |
| **Work Again?** | **15%** | (Strongest Signal) Would you run for them again? |
| **Communication** | **10%** | Proactive and clear? |

## 3. The Trust Tiers (Institutional Clarity)
Scores are mapped to professional status labels to maintain a neutral, executive tone.
- **4.6+** ➡️ **Elite Reliability**
- **3.5–4.5** ➡️ **Strong Partner**
- **2.9–3.4** ➡️ **Use Standard Caution**
- **<2.9** ➡️ **Elevated Risk**

## 4. Launch Sequence
1. **Phase 1: Build Skeleton (30 Days)**: Direct database capture, private access only.
2. **Phase 2: Veteran Seeding (60 Days)**: Invite-only. 100 Veteran submissions form the "Cultural Baseline."
3. **Phase 3: Controlled Visibility**: Organic distribution through verified operators.

## 5. Competitive Advantage (The Standard vs. Directory 1.0)

Legacy directories (e.g., US Pilot Cars) are static "Lists of Hope." We provide **Risk Intelligence**.

| Feature | Directory 1.0 (Legacy) | The Reliability Standard (Command) |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Type** | Contact Info Only | Operational Risk Index (Payment/Safety/Rate) |
| **Verification** | Self-Reported / Manually Updated | MC/DOT Linked + Community Verified |
| **Trust Factor** | Zero (Just a list) | High (Institutional Decision-Support) |
| **Workflow** | Randomized Calls | Habitual Pre-Move Ritual |

**Status**: INSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY
**Integrity Rule**: Friction is GOOD. Professionals tolerate it; bad actors avoid it.
